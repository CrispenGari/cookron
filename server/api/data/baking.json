      "Tip the flour, yeast, sugar, salt and oil into a bowl. Pour over 325ml warm water, then mix (with a spatula or your hand), until it comes together as a shaggy dough. Make sure all the flour has been incorporated. Cover and leave for 10 mins.",
      "Lightly oil your work surface and tip the dough onto it. Knead the dough for at least 10 mins until it becomes tighter and springy \u2013 if you have a stand mixer you can do this with a dough hook for 5 mins. Pull the dough into a ball and put in a clean, oiled bowl. Leave for 1 hr, or until doubled in size.",
      "Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a long sausage shape. Halve the dough, then divide each half into four pieces, so you have eight equal-sized portions. Roll each into a tight ball and put on a dusted baking tray, leaving some room between each ball for rising. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place to prove for 40 mins-1 hr or until almost doubled in size.",
      "Heat the oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. When the dough is ready, dust each ball with a bit more flour. (If you like, you can glaze the rolls with milk or beaten egg, and top with seeds.) Bake for 25-30mins, until light brown and hollow sounding when tapped on the base. Leave to cool on a wire rack."

Then mix in enough of the remaining water and a bit more if needed, to gather up any dry bits in the bottom of the bowl, until the mixture comes together as a soft, not too sticky, dough. Gather it into a ball with your hands.",
      "Put the dough onto a very lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 mins until it feels smooth and elastic, only adding the minimum of extra flour if necessary to prevent the dough sticking. Place the ball of dough on a lightly floured work surface. Cover with an upturned, clean, large glass bowl and leave for 45 mins-1 hr or until doubled in size and feels light and springy. Timing will depend on the warmth of the room.",
      "Knock back the dough by gently kneading just 3-4 times. You only want to knock out any large air bubbles, so too much handling now will lose the dough\u2019s lightness. Shape into a ball, then cover and leave for 10 mins.",
      "Cut the dough into 10 even pieces. Shape each into a ball and sit them on 2 baking parchment-lined baking sheets. Cover with a clean dry tea towel and leave for 40-45 mins, or until about doubled in size.",
      "Finish by using your fingers press a wide indent in the middle of each roll. Scatter over the roasted peppers, cheese and olives pressing down quite firmly into the indents, finish with rocket. Drizzle with most of the remaining oil mixed with a good pinch of dried oregano. Season.",
      "Put a roasting tin in the bottom of the oven 20 mins before ready to bake and heat oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. Put the risen bread in the oven, carefully pour about 250ml cold water into the roasting tin (this will hiss and create a burst of steam to give you a crisp crust), then lower the heat to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Bake for 20 mins or until golden. Remove and cool on a wire rack. If you tap the underneath of the loaf if should be firm and sound hollow. When baked, drizzle with a little extra olive oil."

Rubbing in mixture with cold butter is hard and tiring on young fingers, so use slightly softened butter \u2013 but not so soft that it is oily. Now stir in the paprika and mix again.",
      "Add 100ml milk and mix with a fork until you get a soft dough. Add a splash more milk if the dough is dry. This process will teach you how to feel the dough and decide if it needs more liquid. You can always add more milk if required.",

Get an adult to put them in the oven for you and bake for 20-25 mins until golden and melty. Ask an adult to remove them from the oven, then leave to cool. The cheese roll-ups will keep for up to 3 days in an airtight container."

Combine the flour, yeast, sugar and 1 tsp salt in a large bowl or stand mixer. Add the cooled butter mixture, and mix to a soft dough using a wooden spoon or the mixer. Knead for 10 mins by hand (or 5 mins using a mixer) until the dough feels bouncy and smooth. Transfer to an oiled bowl and cover with a clean tea towel. Leave somewhere warm to rise for 1\u00bd-2 hrs, or until doubled in size. Alternatively, leave to prove in the fridge overnight.",

Flatten a small piece of dough (about 20g) into a disc, and put a cube of the mozzarella and a pinch of the gruy\u00e8re into the middle of the disc. Enclose the cheeses with the dough, then roll into a ball. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining cheese and dough, placing the dough balls \u00bdcm apart on the baking sheet \u2013 they should be just touching after proving. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave somewhere warm to rise for 30 mins.",
      "Meanwhile, make the garlic butter. Melt the butter in a small pan over a low heat, then stir in the garlic and rosemary. Remove from the heat and set aside until needed. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Brush the risen dough balls with the garlic butter, then bake for 25-30 mins until the dough balls are cooked through and the middles are oozing.",
      "While the dough balls are baking, make the tomato sauce dip. Heat the oil in a saucepan and fry the garlic for 30 seconds. Tip in the passata, vinegar, sugar and chilli flakes, and simmer for 10 mins until thickened. Season to taste and stir in the basil. Brush the warm dough balls with any remaining garlic butter, then serve with the tomato sauce dip on the side for dunking."

      "Line your largest baking sheet with parchment, and dust with polenta or cornmeal. Drain the mozzarella and dry the balls on some kitchen paper. Tip the dough onto your work surface and punch out the air bubbles. To make a Christmas tree shape, you\u2019ll need 23 balls. Tear off lumps of dough, ensuring each one is roughly the same size (if you want to be exact, weigh the dough, divide the weight by 23, then weigh each ball of dough as you break them off).",
      "Shape each piece of dough into a disc and place a ball of mozzarella in the middle. Pull up the sides of the dough to encase the cheese, pinching the dough together to seal. Roll into a ball and place on the baking sheet, sealed-side down, in a tree shape. Leave a little space between each ball, as they will grow when proving. You\u2019re likely to have 2 or 3 balls without mozzarella, so use these pieces of dough for the trunk \u2013 for anyone who doesn\u2019t like cheese. Cover the tray with a sheet of oiled cling film and set aside for 30 mins until almost doubled in size.",
      "While the dough proves, make the tomato dipping sauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the garlic and sizzle for 30 secs until fragrant. Add the tomatoes, oregano, vinegar, sugar and some seasoning. Bubble for 30 mins until the sauce is thick. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.",
      "When the dough is ready, uncover the baking sheet and bake for 20-25 mins until golden brown. Meanwhile, make the garlic butter. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the garlic and sizzle for 1-2 mins until the garlic is a shade darker (but not brown). When the bread is cooked, transfer it to a platter. Stir most of the parsley into the garlic butter and use a pastry brush to brush it all over the bread. Leave it to soak in, then brush on more. Sprinkle over a little extra parsley to garnish, if you like. Reheat the tomato sauce and serve it alongside the bread with any remaining garlic butter."

Then mix in enough of the remaining water and a bit more if needed, to gather up any dry bits in the bottom of the bowl and until the mixture comes together as a soft, not too sticky, dough. Gather it into a ball with your hands.",

Place the ball of dough on a lightly floured work surface. Cover with an upturned, clean, large glass bowl and leave for 45 mins-1 hr or until doubled in size and feels light and springy. Timing will depend on the warmth of the room.",

For each plait, lay 2 dough sausages in front of you like an X, then lay the other piece lengthways down the middle of the X and scatter over a few slices of proscuitto. Start to plait from the centre down, left over right, right over left etc. When you reach the end, carefully turn the plait over and complete the plaiting, working down from the centre again.

Put the risen bread in the oven, carefully pour about 250ml cold water into the roasting tin (this will hiss and create a burst of steam to give you a crisp crust), then lower the heat to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Bake for 25 mins or until golden. Remove and cool on a wire rack. If you tap the underneath of the loaf if should be firm and sound hollow. Finish by brushing with beaten egg."

      "Mix your choice of brown flour with the white, the yeast and salt in a large mixing bowl. Put in the butter and rub it into the flour. Stir in the seeds if using. Make a dip in the centre of the flour and pour in almost 300ml hand warm (cool rather than hot) water, with a round-bladed knife. Then mix in enough of the remaining water and a bit more if needed, to gather up any dry bits in the bottom of the bowl and until the mixture comes together as a soft, not too sticky, dough. Gather it into a ball with your hands.",
      "Put the dough on to a very lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 mins until it feels smooth and elastic, only adding the minimum of extra flour if necessary to prevent the dough sticking. Place the ball of dough on a lightly floured work surface. Cover with an upturned, clean, large glass bowl and leave for 45 mins-1 hr or until doubled in size and feels light and springy. Timing will depend on the warmth of the room.",
      "Knock back the dough by lightly kneading just 3-4 times. You only want to knock out any large air bubbles, so too much handling now will lose the dough\u2019s lightness. Shape into a ball. Cover with the glass bowl and leave for 15 mins.",
      "Now shape to make a tin loaf Grease a 1.2-litre capacity loaf tin (about 23 x 13 x 5.5cm) and line the base with baking parchment. Using your knuckles, flatten the dough into a rectangle about 25 x 19cm. Fold both shorter ends into the centre like an envelope, make a \u00bc turn, then flatten again into the same size and roll up very tightly, starting from one of the short ends. Roll the top of the dough in extra seeds and place in the tin with the join underneath, pressing the seeds gently into the dough. Cover with a clean tea towel. Leave for 40-45 mins, or until risen about 5cm above the top of the tin.",
      "Put a roasting tin in the bottom of the oven 20 mins before ready to bake and heat oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. Put the risen bread in the oven, carefully pour about 250ml cold water into the roasting tin (this will hiss and create a burst of steam to give you a crisp crust), then lower the heat to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Bake for about 30 mins or until golden, covering with foil for the last 5 mins if starting to brown too quickly. Leave in the tin for 2-3 mins, then remove and cool on a wire rack. If you tap the underneath of the baked loaf if should be firm and sound hollow."

Using a stand mixer or electric hand mixer, beat the butter, muscovado sugar and 140g honey until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs and yolks, one at a time, beating after each addition until well incorporated. In a clean bowl, whisk together the flour, almonds, baking powder and 1 / 4 tsp salt. Add half the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat until just combined. Add the vanilla and milk, continuing to beat, then add the remaining flour mixture, beating until just combined. Divide the mixture evenly between the tins and bake for 45-55 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of each cake comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool for 10 mins in their tins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Leave the oven on for the candied almonds.",

Meanwhile, spread the almonds out on a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 10-12 mins until golden brown. Heat the sugar syrup to 119C, turn off the heat and stir in the warm almonds. Keep stirring until the syrup coats the nuts and turns white and crunchy. Tip the almonds back onto the baking sheet and roughly chop half of them.",
      "Next, make the Swiss meringue buttercream. Using a stand mixer or electric hand mixer, beat the butter until pale and fluffy. Put the egg whites and sugar in a clean heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Whisk using a clean electric hand mixer and heat the mixture until the sugar has dissolved (you can check this by feeling some of the egg white between your fingers to check that it isn\u2019t grainy). Remove the bowl from the heat and, using a stand or electric hand mixer, whisk for 10 mins or until the mixture forms stiff peaks and has cooled to room temperature. Add the butter, 1-2 tbsp at a time, and beat until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Beat in the honey and transfer to a piping bag fitted with a 1cm nozzle.",
      "To assemble the cake, level the sponges by cutting off the domed tops and split each sponge in half to create four layers. Fix the bottom layer to a cake board or stand with a splodge of buttercream, brush with the honey syrup and pipe a layer of buttercream on top. Gently press the second layer on top and repeat with the remaining layers. Cover the cake with a thin layer of buttercream, then use a palette knife to scrape the sides clean. Pipe a ring of buttercream blobs around the top, or spread a thick layer with a palette knife. Decorate with the candied almonds."

Using the dairy-free spread, butter a 23cm springform cake tin and line with a double layer of baking parchment. Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.",

Use the rolling pin to help you lift the marzipan circle over the cake and gently press it onto the surface (the apricot jam will help it stick). Divide the remaining marzipan into 11 pieces and roll into balls. Use a little more jam to stick the balls around the edge of the cake \u2013 these represent the 12 apostles, minus Judas. If you like, use a kitchen blowtorch to slightly burnish the marzipan balls and topping until just golden (do this carefully so they don't burn)."

Remove from the heat and tip the mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer, or use an electric whisk, and whisk for 10 mins on a medium-high speed until you have a thick meringue.

For the second row, choose the colour that is next in sequence to the colour alongside it, piping over the thinnest part of that smeared blob. As you continue to pipe around the cake following this pattern, you will create a swirl effect of colours.",

Tip the egg yolks, caster sugar and vanilla into a large bowl, and the egg whites into a second large bowl. Combine the flour, almonds and 1 /4 tsp salt in a third bowl.",
      "Using an electric hand whisk, beat the egg whites until doubled in size and holding soft peaks. Transfer the beaters to the egg yolk bowl (no need to clean the beaters first) and whisk until the mixture is thick and pale. Lift the beaters and drizzle the mixture around the bowl \u2013 a ribbon should sit on the surface for 2-3 secs.",
      "With a large metal spoon, transfer a spoonful of egg white to the yolks, and mix to loosen the consistency. Add the remaining whites and gently fold into the yolks, trying to retain as much volume as possible. Stop before the mixture is totally combined. Sprinkle the flour and almond mixture evenly over the surface, then drizzle the cooled butter around the edge of the bowl. Fold everything together until just combined, making sure you scoop the spoon right down to the bottom of the bowl to catch the butter and any pockets of flour. Divide the mixture between the cake tins, level the surfaces, then bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 22-25 mins. Test the cakes are done by inserting a skewer into the centre \u2013 it should come out clean. Cool in their tins on a wire rack for 30 mins, then remove the tins and parchment, and leave to cool completely.",
      "Boil the kettle. Put the gelatine in a bowl of cold water and set aside to soften. Pour 150ml cream and 50ml hot water into a saucepan. Add the matcha powder and whisk over a gentle heat until well combined and steaming. Remove from the heat. Squeeze the water from the gelatine leaves and add them, one by one, to the hot matcha cream, whisking until they\u2019re dissolved. Pour the warm cream into a bowl and put in the fridge to cool to room temperature \u2013 don\u2019t leave it too long or the gelatine will set.",
      "Line the deepest of your 20cm cake tins with a double layer of cling film, ensuring the sides are well covered. Put one of the sponges in the tin, flattest-side down. Pour the remaining 450ml cream into a bowl and add the icing sugar. Whip until the cream is holding soft peaks, then fold through the cooled matcha cream. Scrape the cream into the cake tin and level the surface. Put the remaining sponge on top, flattest-side facing up, pushing the sponge gently into the cream. Wrap the tin in cling film and chill for at least 4 hrs.",
      "Put the cream, chocolate and matcha powder in a saucepan and heat very gently, stirring until the chocolate has melted and the matcha is well mixed in. Set aside to cool and thicken for 10 mins. Remove the cake from the fridge and unwrap the tin. Invert the cake onto a cake stand or plate and remove from the tin and the cling film. Using a palette knife held at a 90-degree angle to the side of the cake, scrape around the edge to remove any excess mousse and give the cake a smooth finish. Using baking parchment, create a tight collar, sitting about 2cm taller than the cake. Pour the cooled chocolate glaze over the top, smoothing it to the edge \u2013 the collar should prevent it from dribbling down the sides. Chill for 30 mins more, or for up to 24 hrs.",
      "Carefully pull off the parchment collar. Hold a chopping board (or another object with a straight edge) over half the cake and dust the exposed surface with icing sugar. Arrange fresh cherries and cherry blossom or another edible flower on top, if you like, and serve immediately."

      "Divide the mixture evenly between three bowls and mix a few drops of colouring into each bowl until fully combined, making each bowl a different shade of purple, getting lighter.

      "While the cake is cooling, make the icing. Beat together the icing sugar and butter until pale and fluffy, mixing in 1 tbsp warm water to loosen the mixture if necessary. Set half of the icing aside in a bowl. Divide the other half of the icing between three bowls and colour each a different shade of blue, a dark, medium and light. Stack the sponges, spreading most of the white icing over each one using a palette knife, then use the palette knife to roughly coat the outside of the cakes with the remaining white icing to create a crumb coat. Chill for 30 mins.",
      "Put each of the blue icing shades in separate piping bags and cut a large 2cm hole at the bottom. Starting with the dark shade at the bottom of the cake, pipe an even ring onto the whole cake, two-three times around. Continue working your way up the cake with the icing getting lighter as you reach the top of the cake. Using a small palette knife, work your way around the join in between each row, gently pushing to join each line together. Save some icing in the piping bags to decorate the top. Smooth over the cake with a large palette knife or cake scraper to create a smooth ombre icing, keeping the excess to decorate the top.",
      "You can either mix all the leftover icing together and put in a clean piping bag with a star nozzle to get a multicoloured effect, or pipe individual shades on the top. Add a few dots around the top of the cake in the varying blue colours to look like waves (using some of the white to look like the top of a crashing wave), and dot around the pearls, sprinkles, shells and mermaid tails, pushing them into the icing on the side of the cake, and on top to finish."

    "steps": [
      "First make the malt sponges. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease and line the bases of 2 x 20cm cake tins with baking parchment. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl and whisk until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking well between each addition. Tip the flour, malt and baking powder into the bowl with \u00bc tsp salt and fold together, then add the yogurt and vanilla, and give everything a final stir. Divide the cake mixture between the 2 tins, level the tops and bake on the middle shelf for 25-30 mins or until a skewer pushed into the centre of the cakes comes out clean. Cool for 10 mins, then remove from the tins, peel off the baking parchment and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Wash the tins.",
      "Now make the chocolate sponges. Grease and line the base of the tins as before and boil the kettle. In the same bowl (don\u2019t worry about washing it), cream the butter and sugar as before, adding the eggs, one at a time, and mixing until combined. Sift in the flour, cocoa and baking powder with \u00bc tsp salt. Fold the mixture together, then add the yogurt, melted chocolate and 100ml boiling water. Stir until combined, then divide between the tins. Bake for 25-30 mins, testing with a skewer as before. Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out, remove the baking parchment and cool completely. The sponges can be made up to 2 days before being iced, cooled and wrapped tightly in cling film.",
      "Make the honeycomb. Grease a baking tray with a little butter or oil. Put the sugar and golden syrup in a large pan. Warm over a medium heat and leave to bubble to a liquid caramel, but don\u2019t stir. When you\u2019re happy with the colour (the darker it gets, the more intense the flavour will be), add the bicarbonate of soda and quickly stir into the syrup. Before the bubbles die down, pour the foaming mixture onto the baking tray, then set aside for 30 mins to cool and firm up.",
      "Make the icing. In your largest mixing bowl, beat the butter with half the icing sugar, the malt and vanilla until smooth. Add the remaining icing sugar and the cream cheese, and beat again until well combined \u2013 don\u2019t overmix or the icing may become runny.",
      "You\u2019re now ready to assemble. Put one of the sponges on a cake stand or cake board, sticking it down with a small blob of icing. Use \u00bc of the icing to stack the cakes, alternating between the malt and chocolate sponges. Place the final sponge on top, flat-side up. When assembled, use a palette knife to cover the entire cake with a thin layer of the icing, filling any gaps between sponges, but don\u2019t worry about completely covering the sponges at this stage. This is called a crumb coat and ensures that your final layer is crumb-free. Make space in your fridge and chill the cake for 30 mins to firm up the icing.",
      "Once the icing is chilled, use the remaining icing to completely cover the cake. This is easiest if you pile the icing on top of the cake, then use a palette knife to ease it over the edge and down the sides. You can make it as smooth or as rough as you like. Chill for another 30 mins.",
      "Make the drizzle. Meanwhile, put the dark chocolate in a bowl and heat the cream in a small pan until just steaming. Pour the cream over the chocolate and leave to melt for 5-10 mins. Stir to make a glossy ganache, then set aside to firm up a little \u2013 you want the ganache to be pourable but not too runny, to make drizzly droplets down the side of the cake.",
      "When the ganache is the correct consistency, remove the cake from the fridge and spoon the ganache over the top edge of the cake, encouraging it to drizzle down the side with your spoon \u2013 start at the back of the cake to get the hang of it. Fill in the middle of the top of the cake with chocolate too.",
      "Break the honeycomb into tall shards and stack them on top of the cake. Finish with whole and halved Maltesers, adding a few around the base, along with some honeycomb crumbs. The cake is best served within 2-3 hrs of assembling, but will still taste delicious for up to 3 days. Store leftovers in the fridge and allow to come back to room temperature before serving."

Take the cakes out of the oven and leave to cool in their tins for five minutes then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.",
      "While the cakes are cooking and cooling make the buttercreams. To make the strawberry buttercream, mash the strawberries in a small bowl with a fork until mushy. In a larger bowl whisk up the butter and half the icing sugar until smooth, then whisk in the mashed strawberries followed by the remaining icing sugar. Whisk until smooth and pale pink and place in the fridge until needed. Repeat the process with the lemon buttercream.",
      "Once the cakes are completely cold, put one of the cakes onto a cake turntable and add about one third of the lemon buttercream, spread over the surface evenly then top with half of the soaked strawberry slices. Next, spread one third of the strawberry buttercream onto another of the cakes and top with the remaining strawberry slices. Carefully stack the two filled layers with the final cake on top.",
      "Transfer the remaining buttercreams to disposable piping bags and snip off the ends. Pipe the strawberry buttercream in rings around the outside of the cake, starting at the base. Once you reach three quarters of the way up, switch to the lemon buttercream and continue piping onto the top of the cake. Smooth over the top using a palette knife then smooth the sides with either a large palette knife or, better still a pastry scraper. Use long sweeping movements and gently turn the cake turntable so that you get a smooth finish but a subtle gradient effect where the two colours meet. Scrape any excess icing into a bowl.",

Add a few dots around the top of the cake in the varying blue colours to look like waves (using some of the white to look like the top of a crashing wave), and dot around the pearls, sprinkles, shells and mermaid tails, pushing them into the icing on the side of the cake, and on top to finish."

Beat the eggs a little with a fork, and with the beaters still running, add the eggs a little bit at a time. Wait until each addition has been fully combined before adding more.",
      "Once all of the eggs have been added, fold in the flour with a spatula in three additions, alternating with the yogurt. If the finished batter feels a little stiff, mix in a couple tbsp of milk to loosen it. Transfer the batter into the prepared cake pan and level out with a spatula.",
      "Bake in the preheated oven for about 1 hr 30 \u2013 1 hr 40 mins or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. If the cake is browning too quickly, cover loosely with baking parchment for the last 15 mins of cooking. Allow the cake to cool in the tin for 20 mins.",
      "While the cake is cooling in the tin make the syrup. Place the sugar, 50ml water and vanilla extract into a small saucepan over a medium heat and bring to a simmer, cooking for a few mins until the sugar has dissolved. Transfer the cake onto a wire rack to cool completely then use a skewer to poke holes all over the top of the cake. Use a pastry brush to spread the syrup over the top of the cake, allowing it to soak into the sponge before adding more.",
      "To make the buttercream, beat the butter and icing sugar together with an electric hand whisk until light and fluffy, then add the orange curd and whisk again to combine. If the cake is domed on the top, use a large serrated knife to level it off then cut the cake through the middle, into two layers. Place the bottom layer of cake onto a 23cm round cake board and spread a thin layer of buttercream on the cake and top with the raspberry jam. Place the second layer of cake on top and spread the remaining buttercream over the top and sides of the cake.",
      "On a work surface lightly dusted with icing sugar, knead the red sugarpaste until soft and pliable. Roll it out until about 3-4mm thick and wide enough to cover the cake. Roll the sugarpaste onto the rolling pin and carefully drape over the cake. Gently smooth the sugarpaste down the sides of the cake and trim off the excess with a small sharp knife. Reserve the trimmings for the details later on.",
      "Repeat the rolling process with the yellow sugarpaste but this time cutting into thin strips. Cut 30 strips approx 1.5cm x 10cm and stick to the sides of the cake all the way around, dipping your finger in water to brush onto the back of each one, which will act as glue (the strips should cover the entire height of the cake but only reach a couple of centimetres over the top of cake).",
      "Next roll out the blue sugarpaste to the same thickness as the red and yellow but this time cut out a 20cm circle and stick it in place in the middle of the cake using a little water. Roll out the brown sugarpaste as well and use a thin sharp knife to cut out Duggee\u2019s face and attach to the blue circle.",
      "For Duggee\u2019s clothes knead a little yellow into the remaining brown sugarpaste until it is a light brown colour and use this to cut out his shirt and lip area, sticking with a little water as before. Use the black sugarpaste to roll his eyes and nose, using your hands rather than rolling on the work surface. Use the remaining sugarpaste to shape the decorations for his outfit and mouth and stick as before with a little water. Wrap the ribbon around the bottom edge of the cake and secure with tape or a pin but remember to remove before serving. This cake will keep in a sealed container for up to 4 days."

Whisk until you have a smooth batter. Pour into the tin and bake for 1 hr or until a skewer comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 30 mins, then slice off the top to give you a smooth surface. Flip onto a wire rack and remove the baking parchment. Leave to cool. Can now be covered with cling film and kept for up to 5 days.",
      "To make the buttercream, put the ingredients in a large bowl and mash together with a fork or spatula (this prevents the icing sugar from going everywhere). When roughly combined, blend with an electric hand whisk until smooth.",
      "Now make the marshmallow icing. Put the egg whites, sugar, 1 tbsp water and a good pinch of salt into a heatproof bowl. Place over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the hot water, and whisk until thick and leaving a prominent trail from the beaters \u2013 this will take about 4 mins. Remove the bowl from the heat and continue whisking for another 3 mins until cooled slightly and really stiff. Transfer half to a piping bag fitted with a large round nozzle and set aside.",
      "When ready to assemble, slice the cake lengthways into 3 even layers. On a cake stand or plate, reassemble the cake, with the largest slice on the bottom, layering with the buttercream.",
      "Using a small offset palette knife or small butter knife, cover the cake with the marshmallow icing left in the bowl. Use the palette knife to create vertical lines along the edges (see tip, left). Now use the piping bag to pipe spikes of meringue over the top of the cake. Use a cook\u2019s blowtorch to toast the meringue to a golden brown \u2013 a few charred patches will add to the effect. Serve straight away or chill for up to 2 days, removing from the fridge 30 mins before serving. We decorated ours with sparklers."

Starting from the thicker end, twist the sausage into a tight coil until you have a horn shape. Pinch the small end upwards into a pointed tip. Next, divide the remaining white fondant into two pieces. Roll each one out into a rough oval on a sheet of baking parchment, then pinch the top end of each oval upwards to make a point. Set the ears aside with the horn and leave to dry while you make the cake.",
      "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter the base of three 20cm sandwich tins and line with baking parchment. Beat the butter, sugar and vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric whisk for 8-10 mins until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Sift in the flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt, and fold in using a large metal spoon. Add just enough of the milk to create a soft dropping consistency.",
      "Divide the batter between the prepared tins and smooth the tops with a spatula. Bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 25-30 mins, or until golden and firm to the touch. Leave to cool slightly in the tins, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "While the cake is cooling, make the buttercream. Beat the butter, icing sugar and vanilla together until pale and fluffy, beating in 4-6 tbsp hot water to loosen the mixture if necessary.",
      "Put one of the cooled sponges on a cake board or stand and spread a little of the buttercream on top using a palette knife. Gently spread over half the salted caramel, if using, then sandwich with another sponge. Repeat the process with a little more buttercream, the remaining salted caramel (if using) and the third sponge. Spread the outside of the cake with a thin layer of buttercream \u2013 this doesn't have to be neat. Chill for 30 mins.",
      "Spread a thick, even layer of buttercream over the chilled cake using a palette knife. Divide the remaining buttercream into three bowls and colour each one differently using the gel food colouring. Ours were light pink, purple and dark pink.",
      "Put a little gold lustre dust into a bowl, add a drop of water and stir to make a gold paste. Using a small paintbrush, paint the unicorn horn gold using the paste, as well as the inside of the ears, if you like. Carefully place the gold horn in the middle of the iced cake, with the ears on either side.",
      "Fit three piping bags with three different nozzles (we used a round nozzle and two different-sized star nozzles) and fill each with a different colour of buttercream. Pipe each colour around the ears and horn and all over the top of the cake, coming down one side and over the edge of the front \u2013 this is the unicorn's mane. Decorate with some sprinkles, if using.",
      "Divide the black fondant in two pieces, and roll each into a thin sausage shape. Shape each into an arch, then press onto the front of the cake for eyes. If you like, curve the outer edges of the eyes upwards for eyelashes. Cut into slices and serve. Will keep in the fridge for up to three days."

      "Put the butter and chocolate into a saucepan and melt over a low heat, stirring. When the chocolate has all melted remove from the heat.",
      "In a large bowl mix together the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and muscovado sugar. In another bowl beat together the eggs, soured cream and vanilla extract. Pour the egg and chocolate mixtures into the flour and mix thoroughly together.",
      "Weigh 250g into the loaf tin, then spoon the rest of the mixture into the pudding basin.",
      "Cook both cakes side by side in the oven. The loaf cake will cook in about 30 mins and the basin cake in about 1 hour. Take the loaf cake out of the oven and close the oven door quickly so as not to allow the heat out. Test with a skewer inserted into the centre, it should come out clean. If not return to the oven for another five mins. Repeat with the basin cake after about another half an hour. Once each cake is cooked, allow to cool completely before turning out.",
      "To make the icing, mix together the cocoa and water to make a smooth paste. Beat the butter until soft and gradually beat in the icing sugar. Add the cocoa paste and beat until smooth.",
      "To assemble the cake, trim the top of the basin cake so it is flat. Turn cut side down onto a board and cut in half vertically. Spread a little butter icing on each of the flat bases and sandwich these two buttercreamed surfaces together to make a rugby ball shape for the hedgehog body. Place onto a 30cm cake board or wooden board. Cut the loaf cake in half vertically. Take one half and trim the short end to a v shape to make the pointy head. Use a little icing to attach to the body. Cut pieces from the remaining loaf cake to fill any gaps. Cover the whole cake in butter icing.",
      "Cut the flake bars into pieces ranging from 2.5cm to 5cm. The spikes do not have to be regular or even in shape. Starting at the front push the spikes into the body of the hedgehog at a slight angle. Start with the small pieces gradually using larger ones as you go towards the back. Press a round chocolate into the tip of the head to represent the nose and use chocolate chips for the eyes. Using a tiny bit of butter icing attach sliver or gold balls to the eyes.",
      "The cake is best made the day before cutting and icing and will keep well for 3\u20134 days."

      "Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, ensuring the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the water. Alternatively, melt it in short bursts in the microwave, stirring between each burst. Set the chocolate aside to cool a little while you separate the eggs. Whisk the egg whites and a pinch of salt using electric beaters until they form soft peaks, then gradually add 200g of sugar, continuing to whisk until the egg whites form stiff peaks.",
      "Line a 24cm springform tin with baking parchment. Heat the oven to 170 C/150 fan/gas 3. Using electric beaters, beat the butter and remaining sugar in a large bowl until light and creamy and the sugar has dissolved. Gradually beat in the egg yolks and cooled chocolate. Fold about \u2153 the whisked egg whites into the chocolate mixture. Sift the flour over the mixture in two batches and fold each in. Gently fold in the remaining beaten egg whites using a spatula.",
      "Pour the cake batter into the prepared tin, spread evenly and bake for about 1 hr or until the cake is risen and springy to the touch. Put on a wire rack and leave to cool completely in the tin.",
      "Heat the jam and liqueur (or juice) in a small saucepan, then pour into a bowl through a fine sieve. Loosen the bottom of the cake tin, then slide off the tin and peel away the baking parchment. Halve the base horizontally. Place the bottom layer on a cake stand and spread with half of the jam mixture, then place the other half of the cake on top. Spread a thin layer of the remaining jam all over the cake and leave to dry.",
      "For the chocolate glaze, bring 40ml water and sugar to the boil in a small saucepan until the sugar has dissolved. Leave to cool slightly, then stir in 2 tbsp of the double cream. Heat the remaining cream in a separate pan and stir in the butter until melted. Remove from the heat and gradually add the chocolate, letting it melt into the cream, and stir in the sugar syrup. Place the cake on a cooling rack over a tray to catch any excess glaze. Evenly coat the cake with the glaze by pouring it slowly into the middle, tilting the cake gently so it flows slowly over the edges. Don\u2019t smooth it with a knife or it will look streaky. Best enjoyed fresh but will keep for up to three days.",

Pour the melted chocolate into a small piping bag and pipe onto the still-damp icing in parallel strips, 2-3cm apart. Carefully pull the tip of a spoon alternately from top to bottom through the lines to make the pattern, then allow the glaze to dry."

      "Take a third, large bowl. Use your fingers to break the biscuits into it. Stir in the nuts, soaked fruit and soaking liquid, then mix everything together. Pour the melted chocolate into the bowl with the biscuits, using a spatula or spoon to scrape out every last bit of chocolate. Mix together until everything is coated in chocolate.",
      "Check the ingredients list to make sure everything is accounted for (it\u2019s surprisingly easy to miss something in this recipe), then tip the chocolate mixture into the tin, pushing well into corners and flattening the top. Put in the fridge (no need to cover) for 4 hrs or overnight until set. To serve, remove from tin, peel away the parchment and cut into 16 squares (any crumbly bits that fall off make tasty samples for the cook). Will keep for up to 1 week in an airtight container in the fridge. Can be frozen for up to 1 month."

Scoop the pulp and seeds from the passion fruit into a sieve suspended over a bowl, and push through the juice \u2013 you should have about 100ml.

Place one of the layers into the tin, flat-side down, and spread with a third of the passion fruit mousse \u2013 don\u2019t worry if a little trickles down the sides. Layer the remaining sponges and mousse on top, finishing with a layer of cake. Cover the top of the cake with cling film and chill for at least 4 hrs, or preferably overnight.",

Decorate with a ring of toasted coconut shavings, if you like. Remove the filled passion fruit shells from the fridge and place these on top too, topped with the reserved passion fruit seeds. Chill until ready to serve, but bring out of the fridge 1 hr before slicing (don\u2019t forget to serve the passion fruit jellies to your favourite guests too).

      "Make the icing. In your largest mixing bowl, beat the butter with half the icing sugar, the malt and vanilla until smooth. Add the remaining icing sugar and the cream cheese, and beat again until well combined \u2013 don\u2019t overmix or the icing may become runny.",
      "You\u2019re now ready to assemble. Put one of the sponges on a cake stand or cake board, sticking it down with a small blob of icing. Use \u00bc of the icing to stack the cakes, alternating between the malt and chocolate sponges. Place the final sponge on top, flat-side up. When assembled, use a palette knife to cover the entire cake with a thin layer of the icing, filling any gaps between sponges, but don\u2019t worry about completely covering the sponges at this stage. This is called a crumb coat and ensures that your final layer is crumb-free. Make space in your fridge and chill the cake for 30 mins to firm up the icing.",
      "Once the icing is chilled, use the remaining icing to completely cover the cake. This is easiest if you pile the icing on top of the cake, then use a palette knife to ease it over the edge and down the sides. You can make it as smooth or as rough as you like. Chill for another 30 mins.",
      "Make the drizzle. Meanwhile, put the dark chocolate in a bowl and heat the cream in a small pan until just steaming. Pour the cream over the chocolate and leave to melt for 5-10 mins. Stir to make a glossy ganache, then set aside to firm up a little \u2013 you want the ganache to be pourable but not too runny, to make drizzly droplets down the side of the cake.",
      "When the ganache is the correct consistency, remove the cake from the fridge and spoon the ganache over the top edge of the cake, encouraging it to drizzle down the side with your spoon \u2013 start at the back of the cake to get the hang of it. Fill in the middle of the top of the cake with chocolate too.",
      "Break the honeycomb into tall shards and stack them on top of the cake. Finish with whole and halved Maltesers, adding a few around the base, along with some honeycomb crumbs. The cake is best served within 2-3 hrs of assembling, but will still taste delicious for up to 3 days. Store leftovers in the fridge and allow to come back to room temperature before serving."

Put them in a pan and cover with water, then bring to the boil. Cook for 1 min, then drain and rinse. Dry and set aside. Juice the limes and add enough water to make 225ml. Heat gently with the sugar until the sugar has melted. Add the strips of zest and simmer until the liquid has almost evaporated and turned syrupy \u2013 about 30 mins. Scoop the strips of zest out with a slotted spoon, then place them on parchment to dry.",
      "To make the buttercream, beat the butter and icing sugar together using an electric mixer or by hand (start off gently or the icing sugar will fly everywhere), until pale and light, but don\u2019t beat for so long that it gets too fluffy. Add the lime zest and beat again until smooth. Chill in the fridge until the buttercream is firm, but spreadable.",
      "To make the icing, heat the cream gently (don't let it boil), then take it off the heat. Add the chocolate and let it melt, stirring to help it along. Put the marmalade in a small pan with the extra 1 tbsp cream and heat slowly to dissolve. Add to the chocolate and cream and stir until everything is blended.

Flatten out the pastry with your hands, wrap the dough in cling film, then chill for at least 30 mins. While the pastry is chilling, make the filling. Beat all the ingredients, except for the zest, together. Sieve the mixture, then stir in the zest.",

Bake for 10 mins, then remove the tart tin from the oven, discard the foil, and bake for another 20 mins until biscuity. When the pastry is ready, remove it from the oven, pour in the lemon mixture and bake again for 30-35 mins until just set. Leave to cool, then remove the tart from the tin and serve at room temperature or chilled."

      "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Lay the squash slices on a baking tray and sprinkle over a little of the caster sugar. Bake for 20 mins or until the squash is still slightly resistant to a sharp knife, but not hard. Don\u2019t overcook the squash, or it will break when you try to move it.",
      "Meanwhile, scatter the rest of the sugar into an ovenproof frying pan about 20cm across, and heat it gently until it melts and starts to caramelise. Tip the pan if you need to combine patches of sugar that haven\u2019t melted into the liquid parts, but don\u2019t be tempted to stir. When you have a medium amber-coloured caramel, sprinkle on the spices and lemon juice. Turn the heat off.",
      "Take the squash out of the oven and leave to cool for a couple of mins. Use tongs to place the squash in the frying pan, gently arranging the slices in a tight spiral on the caramel. Start with a large slice in the centre and lay the other slices on top so it looks neat when you turn it out. When the squash is all in the pan, turn the heat on again and cook until the caramel starts to bubble. Turn the heat down and cook for about 10-15 mins, making sure the caramel doesn\u2019t burn. You want the squash to give off any water and then to start absorbing the caramel \u2013 the caramel will start to get very liquid as this happens, so turn the heat up at the end and make sure the caramel thickens up completely. Turn the heat off, drop the butter into the centre of the pan and wait for it to melt.",
      "Cut the pastry into a rough circle just bigger than the pan and drape it over the squash, folding any excess over on itself and carefully tucking it in around the edge. Bake for 20 mins, then turn the heat down to 160C/140C fan/gas 3 and bake for a further 20 mins. Turn out onto a plate while the tarte is hot so the squash and caramel release easily. Serve with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or ice cream."

Tip in the double cream and fold it into the soft cheese mix. You\u2019re looking for it to be thickened enough to hold its shape when you tip a spoon of it upside down. If it\u2019s not thick enough, continue to whisk. Spoon onto the biscuit base, starting from the edges and working inwards, making sure that there are no air bubbles. Smooth the top of the cheesecake down with the back of a dessert spoon or spatula. Leave to set in the fridge overnight.",

Slip the cake onto a serving plate, removing the lining paper and base. Pur\u00e9e half the strawberries in a blender or food processor with the icing sugar and 1 tsp water, then sieve.

Alternatively, melt it in short bursts in the microwave, stirring between each burst. Set the chocolate aside to cool a little while you separate the eggs. Whisk the egg whites and a pinch of salt using electric beaters until they form soft peaks, then gradually add 200g of sugar, continuing to whisk until the egg whites form stiff peaks.",
      "Line a 24cm springform tin with baking parchment. Heat the oven to 170 C/150 fan/gas 3. Using electric beaters, beat the butter and remaining sugar in a large bowl until light and creamy and the sugar has dissolved. Gradually beat in the egg yolks and cooled chocolate. Fold about \u2153 the whisked egg whites into the chocolate mixture. Sift the flour over the mixture in two batches and fold each in. Gently fold in the remaining beaten egg whites using a spatula.",
      "Pour the cake batter into the prepared tin, spread evenly and bake for about 1 hr or until the cake is risen and springy to the touch. Put on a wire rack and leave to cool completely in the tin.",
      "Heat the jam and liqueur (or juice) in a small saucepan, then pour into a bowl through a fine sieve. Loosen the bottom of the cake tin, then slide off the tin and peel away the baking parchment. Halve the base horizontally. Place the bottom layer on a cake stand and spread with half of the jam mixture, then place the other half of the cake on top. Spread a thin layer of the remaining jam all over the cake and leave to dry.",
      "For the chocolate glaze, bring 40ml water and sugar to the boil in a small saucepan until the sugar has dissolved. Leave to cool slightly, then stir in 2 tbsp of the double cream. Heat the remaining cream in a separate pan and stir in the butter until melted. Remove from the heat and gradually add the chocolate, letting it melt into the cream, and stir in the sugar syrup. Place the cake on a cooling rack over a tray to catch any excess glaze. Evenly coat the cake with the glaze by pouring it slowly into the middle, tilting the cake gently so it flows slowly over the edges. Don\u2019t smooth it with a knife or it will look streaky. Best enjoyed fresh but will keep for up to three days.",

Pour the melted chocolate into a small piping bag and pipe onto the still-damp icing in parallel strips, 2-3cm apart. Carefully pull the tip of a spoon alternately from top to bottom through the lines to make the pattern, then allow the glaze to dry."

      "Take a third, large bowl. Use your fingers to break the biscuits into it. Stir in the nuts, soaked fruit and soaking liquid, then mix everything together. Pour the melted chocolate into the bowl with the biscuits, using a spatula or spoon to scrape out every last bit of chocolate. Mix together until everything is coated in chocolate.",
      "Check the ingredients list to make sure everything is accounted for (it\u2019s surprisingly easy to miss something in this recipe), then tip the chocolate mixture into the tin, pushing well into corners and flattening the top. Put in the fridge (no need to cover) for 4 hrs or overnight until set. To serve, remove from tin, peel away the parchment and cut into 16 squares (any crumbly bits that fall off make tasty samples for the cook). Will keep for up to 1 week in an airtight container in the fridge. Can be frozen for up to 1 month."

Put all the other ingredients in a large mixing bowl and, when the chocolate and butter have melted, pour over and mix with an electric whisk until smooth and well combined. Set aside and rinse the beaters.",
      "In another large bowl, add all the sesame cake ingredients, then combine with an electric whisk until smooth.",
      "Alternating with dollops of each mixture, divide between the two tins. Level the top, then swirl a skewer through the mixture to create a marbled effect. Bake in the middle of the oven for 45-50 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave the cakes to cool completely on a wire rack while you make the topping (there\u2019s enough for both cakes but the topping recipe is easily halved if you want to freeze one and ice it later)",
      "Heat the double cream and butter together gently in a small pan until just simmering, then remove from the heat and add the chocolate. Stir until the mixture is smooth, then place in the fridge for 20 mins to firm up.",
      "Beat well with a wooden spoon, then transfer to a disposable piping bag. Snip the end off to make a wide opening, then pipe thick, overlapping zigzags across the cakes. Cut the sesame snaps into shards and arrange on top, scattering over any crumbs, then serve."

Layer the remaining sponges and mousse on top, finishing with a layer of cake. Cover the top of the cake with cling film and chill for at least 4 hrs, or preferably overnight.",

Decorate with a ring of toasted coconut shavings, if you like. Remove the filled passion fruit shells from the fridge and place these on top too, topped with the reserved passion fruit seeds. Chill until ready to serve, but bring out of the fridge 1 hr before slicing (don\u2019t forget to serve the passion fruit jellies to your favourite guests too). Leftovers will keep in the fridge for 2 days."

In the same bowl (don\u2019t worry about washing it), cream the butter and sugar as before, adding the eggs, one at a time, and mixing until combined. Sift in the flour, cocoa and baking powder with \u00bc tsp salt. Fold the mixture together, then add the yogurt, melted chocolate and 100ml boiling water. Stir until combined, then divide between the tins. Bake for 25-30 mins, testing with a skewer as before. Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out, remove the baking parchment and cool completely. The sponges can be made up to 2 days before being iced, cooled and wrapped tightly in cling film.",
      "Make the honeycomb. Grease a baking tray with a little butter or oil. Put the sugar and golden syrup in a large pan. Warm over a medium heat and leave to bubble to a liquid caramel, but don\u2019t stir. When you\u2019re happy with the colour (the darker it gets, the more intense the flavour will be), add the bicarbonate of soda and quickly stir into the syrup. Before the bubbles die down, pour the foaming mixture onto the baking tray, then set aside for 30 mins to cool and firm up.",
      "Make the icing. In your largest mixing bowl, beat the butter with half the icing sugar, the malt and vanilla until smooth. Add the remaining icing sugar and the cream cheese, and beat again until well combined \u2013 don\u2019t overmix or the icing may become runny.",
      "You\u2019re now ready to assemble. Put one of the sponges on a cake stand or cake board, sticking it down with a small blob of icing. Use \u00bc of the icing to stack the cakes, alternating between the malt and chocolate sponges. Place the final sponge on top, flat-side up. When assembled, use a palette knife to cover the entire cake with a thin layer of the icing, filling any gaps between sponges, but don\u2019t worry about completely covering the sponges at this stage. This is called a crumb coat and ensures that your final layer is crumb-free. Make space in your fridge and chill the cake for 30 mins to firm up the icing.",
      "Once the icing is chilled, use the remaining icing to completely cover the cake. This is easiest if you pile the icing on top of the cake, then use a palette knife to ease it over the edge and down the sides. You can make it as smooth or as rough as you like. Chill for another 30 mins.",
      "Make the drizzle. Meanwhile, put the dark chocolate in a bowl and heat the cream in a small pan until just steaming. Pour the cream over the chocolate and leave to melt for 5-10 mins. Stir to make a glossy ganache, then set aside to firm up a little \u2013 you want the ganache to be pourable but not too runny, to make drizzly droplets down the side of the cake.",
      "When the ganache is the correct consistency, remove the cake from the fridge and spoon the ganache over the top edge of the cake, encouraging it to drizzle down the side with your spoon \u2013 start at the back of the cake to get the hang of it. Fill in the middle of the top of the cake with chocolate too.",
      "Break the honeycomb into tall shards and stack them on top of the cake. Finish with whole and halved Maltesers, adding a few around the base, along with some honeycomb crumbs. The cake is best served within 2-3 hrs of assembling, but will still taste delicious for up to 3 days. Store leftovers in the fridge and allow to come back to room temperature before serving."

Swap the tins around in the oven after 15 mins to ensure they cook evenly. Cool on wire racks completely before icing.",
      "Meanwhile, make the icing by beating the butter with half of the icing sugar until combined and fluffy. Add the cream cheese and the rest of the icing sugar, beating again until fully combined. Drizzle over the vanilla paste and beat until incorporated. Put a large round nozzle into a piping bag and spoon in the icing.",
      "When the cakes have cooled put a blob of icing onto a cake board and sit 1 of the sponges on top. Pipe blobs of vanilla icing in a circle covering the whole base of the sponge, then top with the next sponge. Repeat with all 3 layers, scattering over some extra sprinkles on the top. Serve in slices."

Put the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, sugar and 1 tsp salt in a bowl and mix well. If there are any lumps in the sugar, squeeze these through your fingers to break them up.",
      "Measure the buttermilk, coffee, oil and vanilla in a jug. Add the egg and whisk until smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk until well combined. Pour the cake mixture evenly into the two tins, and bake for 25-30 mins until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool. These sponges can be made up to three days ahead and will stay moist if wrapped in cling film, or you can wrap well and freeze for up to two months.",
      "To make the chocolate fudge icing, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl, suspended over a pan of barely simmering water. Stir every now and then until melted. (Alternatively, melt in the microwave, stirring the chocolate every 20 secs so it doesn\u2019t burn.) Remove the bowl from the heat and leave to cool a little. Meanwhile, put the butter and icing sugar in another large bowl and mash with a spatula to combine (this will prevent you covering the work surface in icing sugar), then whisk with a hand mixer until smooth. Sift in the cocoa and pour in the melted chocolate and milk, then mix again until smooth.",
      "Use roughly half the icing to sandwich the cakes together on a cake stand or board. Use a palette knife to cover the entire cake with the remaining icing \u2013 don\u2019t worry about being too neat. Use the chocolate fingers to cover the sides of the cakes \u2013 do this straight after icing as the icing will set after a while, and the chocolate fingers won\u2019t stick.",
      "Melt the remaining 50g chocolate in the microwave or in a small bowl suspended over a pan of gently simmering water. Leave to cool until the chocolate is a spreadable consistency. You can speed this up by putting it in the fridge \u2013 just stir it every 5 mins or so to prevent the chocolate from setting.",
      "Push a skewer into the centre of the cake and slip the straw over the top \u2013 this will give it more stability. Push 1-2cm of the straw into the cake. Use a cutlery knife to spread a blob of chocolate onto a sugar coated chocolate sweet and, starting at the base, stick the sweets to the straw. You will have to do this in stages to allow the chocolate to set a little before adding another layer of sweets. Work your way up the straw until it\u2019s completely covered. If the chocolate in your bowl becomes too firm, simply heat again until it is at the correct consistency. Stop when you reach the bend in the straw.",
      "Stick the remaining skewer into the top of the straw so that it pokes out at an angle. Place the paper bag on top \u2013 you may have to use a little sticky tape to hold it in place. If any of the straw is exposed, cover it with more sweets.",
      "Tip the remaining sweets on top of the cake to flood the surface. Will keep well stored in an airtight tin for 2 days."

Use the chocolate to stick on the chocolate balls for canon balls, finger biscuits stacked up as canons and chocolate caramels for port holes. Using a little of the marzipan, roll out and cut four windows. Make window frames from brown icing trimmings, rolling out to thin sausages to form a cross and sticking with chocolate. Attach to the sides of the ship with chocolate. Poke the chocolate stick out of the front of the prow, if using.",

Stack the sponges, spreading most of the white icing over each one using a palette knife, then use the palette knife to roughly coat the outside of the cakes with the remaining white icing to create a crumb coat. Chill for 30 mins.",
      "Put each of the blue icing shades in separate piping bags and cut a large 2cm hole at the bottom. Starting with the dark shade at the bottom of the cake, pipe an even ring onto the whole cake, two-three times around. Continue working your way up the cake with the icing getting lighter as you reach the top of the cake. Using a small palette knife, work your way around the join in between each row, gently pushing to join each line together. Save some icing in the piping bags to decorate the top. Smooth over the cake with a large palette knife or cake scraper to create a smooth ombre icing, keeping the excess to decorate the top.",
      "You can either mix all the leftover icing together and put in a clean piping bag with a star nozzle to get a multicoloured effect, or pipe individual shades on the top. Add a few dots around the top of the cake in the varying blue colours to look like waves (using some of the white to look like the top of a crashing wave), and dot around the pearls, sprinkles, shells and mermaid tails, pushing them into the icing on the side of the cake, and on top to finish."

Bake in the oven for about 45 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Cool. When cold, slice the top off the cake to make it level.",
      "To make the mint cake, grease and base line your 20cm cake tin with baking parchment. Put the butter into a bowl and beat until soft. Add the remaining ingredients and beat well until light and creamy. Spoon into the tin and spread level.

      "To make the butter icing, put the butter into a bowl and beat until soft. Gradually beat in the icing sugar. Slice the chocolate and mint cakes in half horizontally so you have four layers. Using an 8cm round cutter, stamp a circle from the centre of each layer. Place the bottom layer of chocolate cake on a 25cm cake board. Spread with a little butter icing. Place the bottom green layer on top. Spread with butter icing and place the other chocolate layer on top. Spread with more icing and place the rounded green sponge on top.",
      "Fill the centre hole with sweets, almost to the top. Take one of the 8cm green sponge pieces and slice in half horizontally. Place one piece on the cake to cover the hole containing the sweets. Spread the top with the remaining butter icing. Roll out about 300g of the white fondant icing to a 20cm circle and place on top of the cake.",
      "Brush the sides of the cake with apricot jam. Measure the circumference of the cake and the depth. Add 2.5cm to the depth measurement. Using these measurements roll out the green fondant to a long strip. (You may find it easier to do two shorter strips). Attach the strip around the cake. Use scissors snip around the top edge to represent grass.",
      "Make a cardboard template of a pentagon (5 sides). Roll out the black icing and cut out six pentagons. Place them on the cake as for a football. If you wish to stick them in place use a little icing sugar mixed with water.",
      "With the remaining white icing trimmings make a scarf and paint with food colouring in your team colours. Drape the scarf over the edge of the cake. Add candles as desired."

    ],
    "steps": [
      "Make the 15cm fruit cake. You can do this up to a month in advance and wrap it in cling film. Once a week you can feed it with a little dark rum or brandy by poking holes in the top and spooning a little into the holes.",
      "Marzipan the fruitcake. Heat the apricot jam until bubbling, then take off the heat. Sieve if necessary to remove any bits. Level off the top of the fruit cake using a long serrated bread knife. Brush the top with jam and flip the cake over and position it on top of the 15cm cake board. Briefly knead the marzipan and smooth into a ball. Dust the work surface with icing sugar. Roll out into a circle. Use a bit of string or tape measure to measure your fruit cake\u2019s top and sides so you know how far to roll out the dough. Brush the cake with apricot jam and then carefully transfer the marzipan to the cake (see picture 1). Gently smooth the top first, then ease your hands down the sides, carefully lifting and coaxing the marzipan so that it fits without overlapping (see picture 2). When you have reached the bottom edges of the cake, use a sharp knife to shave off any excess marzipan. You can do this up to a month in advance.",
      "Ice the cake drum (see picture 4). Lightly knead 500g icing and form into a ball. Dust your work surface with sifted icing sugar and roll out the icing in a circle using a tape measure to check that it is wide enough (23cm). Brush the drum with cooled boiled water and transfer the icing to the board. Gently roll over the board again, then trim the edges with a small sharp knife. Roll gently again if you like to get a really smooth finish. Watch out for fingerprints and bits of fluff as ready-to-roll icing can be quite delicate.You can do this in advance too. If you do, put it in a cake box to stop it gathering dust.",
      "Make the 23cm lemon cake. The unfilled cake will keep well if you wrap it with baking parchment and cling film for up to 4 days, or in the freezer for up to a month.",
      "Buttercream the zingy lemon cake. Make buttercream by beating together the butter, icing sugar and lemon zest. You can do this the day before icing.",
      "Level off the top of the lemon cake using a long serrated bread knife. Spread a little of the buttercream onto the 23cm cake board. Turn cake upside down onto the board. Brush all over with a thin layer of the sieved apricot jam - this helps to stop crumbs getting into the buttercream. Cut the cake in half horizontally using the bread knife. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s not perfect as people won\u2019t be able to see once the cake is covered. Use a palette knife to spread a layer of buttercream onto the top of the cut side of the cake on the board. Put the top layer back on and press down a little to level it. Spread the remaining buttercream on the top and sides of the cake using the palette knife to smooth the surface (see picture 3). Pop the cake in the fridge until the buttercream is firm, this will make it easier to ice.",
      "To cover the cakes in the icing, you\u2019ll need 500g for the smaller cake and 900g for the larger one. For each, gently work the icing into a ball. Dust the work surface with icing sugar and roll it into a circle. Again use a tape measure or piece of string to ensure the circle is big enough to cover the cake. In the case of the fruitcake, brush the marzipan with cooled boiled water, then transfer the icing onto the cake and smooth it down in the same way as the marzipan. Use a cake smoother if you have one to get a really smooth finish (see picture 5). For the lemon cake, you won\u2019t need any additional gluing, the buttercream will do the job. Once you have smoothed the icing over the cake, trim it carefully. A ribbon will hide the bottom of the cake so it doesn\u2019t need to be perfect. Save any leftover icing to make the decorations. Wrap it in clingfilm and put into a freezer bag to seal out the air.",
      "To stack the cakes, use three plastic dowels, these help to keep the cake stable and level. Insert three dowels in a triangle, 2cms in from where the edges of the smaller cake will be (see picture 6). With a pen, mark where the top of the icing comes to on the dowel. Carefully pull out the dowels, you can use tweezers for this, and line them up. Pick the dowel with the highest mark, this is the length you want all the dowels to be. Score the dowels with scissors at this length and cut or snap the plastic.",
      "Put the rods back into the three holes, rounded end down. Smooth a little leftover buttercream onto cake where the dowels are. Pick the best side of the smaller cake and aim to position this at the front. Carefully lift it onto the larger one, you can use a palette knife to help you lower the cake.",
      "To decorate, pinch off a small ball of icing and leave it white. Divide the remaining icing into quarters. Dye two quarters brown. Do this by dipping a toothpick into the colouring paste and gradually adding more colour to the icing, kneading it as you go (see picture 7). Keep going until you have the colour you want and it is smoothly incorporated with no streaks. It\u2019s better to do this gradually as the colours can be quite strong and it\u2019s easy to add too much.",
      "Dye the remaining two balls of icing in your chosen pastels. Wrap all of the balls in clingfilm and pop into a freezer bag until ready to use. This will stop them from becoming crusty.",
      "Start by decorating the bottom layer. Roll out the icing, cutting out approximately 12 shapes. We did six brown teddies and alternated them with either a pink duck (three in total) or a blue duck (three in total). Paint a small amount of edible glue onto the back of each teddy and stick it on. Then repeat with the ducks, placing them between the teddies. For the top layer, we cut out 12 small bunnies, alternating brown, blue, pink, brown, blue pink etc. Stick the shapes with even spacing between them on to the cake. The number of shapes you need will depend on the size of the cutters you\u2019ve chosen.",
      "To make the teddy, roll out one small ball for the head and one slightly larger one for the body. Stick the head on top of the body. Roll out two sausages of icing one for the legs and one for the arms. Cut them in half. Stick the arms to the side of the body and flatten the ends to form little paws. Next stick on the legs, again flattening the ends to form paws. Roll two small balls of brown, flatten and cup them slightly to make ears. Make a little ball of white icing to stick onto the face to make a muzzle. Dip a toothpick into the brown colouring paste and do two dots for eyes. Roll tiny balls of icing for the nose (in brown) and buttons (in white) and stick them on. If you like, take some white icing and make pads for the feet and for the inner ears too (see picture 9).",
      "To make the rabbit, roll a sausage of pink or blue icing and snip the top and the bottom one third along. Form the top into ears and the bottom into legs. Pinch a neck about 1 cm under the ears and then snip each side upwards from the legs to just below the neck to form arms and mould them slightly (see picture 8). Make a face by dipping your toothpick back into the brown paste and draw on eyes, a nose and whiskers. Sit the teddy on top of the cake and arrange the bunny on his lap.",
      "If you like and are handy with writing icing, write the child\u2019s name on the second tier or stick a candle there."

      "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease and line two 20cm cake tins with baking parchment \u2013 if your cake tins are quite shallow, line the sides to a depth of at least 5cm. Put 200g flour, 8 tbsp cocoa powder, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, 280g light brown soft sugar and 1 tsp salt in a bowl and mix well.

      "Measure 200ml buttermilk, 100ml coffee, 150ml oil and 2 tsp vanilla in a jug. Add 2 eggs and whisk until smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk until well combined. Pour the cake mixture evenly into the two tins, and bake for 25-30 mins until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool.",
      "Repeat steps 1 and 2, so that you have 4 sponge cakes in total. These sponges can be made up to three days ahead and will stay moist if wrapped in cling film, or you can wrap well and freeze for up to two months.",
      "To make the icing, put the butter in a large bowl and sieve in half the icing sugar. Roughly mash together with a spatula, then whizz with a hand mixer until smooth. Add the cream cheese and sieve in the remaining icing sugar, mash together again, then blend once more with the hand mixer. Put the biscuits in a food processor and whizz to fine crumbs. Add the biscuit crumbs to the icing and mix again until combined.",
      "Next, make the cookie cake toppers. You\u2019ll need one biscuit for each letter of the word you\u2019d like to write \u2013 someone\u2019s name or, like we have done, \u2018WOW!\u2019 Carefully insert a skewer into the creamy filling in the middle of each biscuit \u2013 some cookies may break, so save these ones for later. Melt the chocolate in the microwave, stirring every 20 secs or so, or in a heatproof bowl suspended over a pan of gently simmering water. Spread a little chocolate over the surface of one side of each cookie. Roll out the fondant icing to the thickness of a 50p coin, and cut out your letters, then stick these to the cookies and set aside to dry. Alternatively, let the chocolate dry, then use an icing pen to write the name or word directly on the surface.",
      "To assemble the cake, stick one of your sponges to a cake stand or board with a little of the cream cheese icing. Use roughly half the icing to stack the remaining cakes on top, spreading a generous amount between each layer. Pile the remaining icing on top of the assembled cake, and use a palette knife to ease it over the edges, covering the entire surface of the cake. Tidy the plate with a piece of kitchen paper.",
      "If you have any leftover biscuits, break them into pieces and push these around the base of the cake. Insert the dried cookie cake toppers into the top of the cake and serve. Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 2 days, but bring back to room temperature for an hour or so before eating."

Add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with the buttermilk. Divide the batter between the tins and level the tops.",

Lightly whisk until the sugar has fully dissolved \u2013 you can test this by dipping two fingers into the bowl and rubbing them together; if you can\u2019t feel any grains of sugar, the mixture is ready. Remove the bowl from the heat and keep whisking until a thick meringue has formed. Continue whisking until the meringue has cooled to room temperature, then slowly add in the butter, 1 tbsp at a time. By the time all the butter has been incorporated, the mixture should have transformed into a silky-smooth buttercream. If it hasn\u2019t, continue to whisk until it does. If it still refuses to thicken, it may be the mixture is still too warm, so chill for 10 mins, then continue whisking. Add the vanilla extract and mix to combine.",
      "To assemble the cake, place a sponge on a cake board or serving plate and top with a thin layer of buttercream. Repeat with the remaining cake layers and finish by spreading the remaining buttercream over the top and sides of the cake (see below). To get a smooth finish, use the edge of a palette knife, and drag carefully around the sides of the cake, smoothing out the buttercream. To decorate the cake, press the sides of it with the edible polka dot sprinkles creating a full border at the bottom with less and less the further up the cake you go. Best served within 2 days of baking, but the cake will keep for up to 4 days."

Cover with a clean, damp cloth and set aside for 30 mins.",

Use your hands to work the softened butter into the dough \u2013 this will take about 5 mins. At first, it will look like it\u2019s not coming together, but keep working the dough through your fingers and it will become smooth and glossy. Form the dough into a ball and return it to the bowl. Cover and leave in a warm place to prove for 2-3 hrs, or until nearly doubled in size. Line a baking tray with baking parchment.",
      "Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to a 2cm thickness, then use a 9cm cutter to stamp out as many circles as you can. Use a 4cm cutter to stamp out the middles. Re-roll the trimmings (including the middles) and stamp out more (you should end up with six ring doughnuts). Re-roll any remaining trimmings and use the 4cm cutter to stamp out five or six mini bites. Put the doughnuts and bites on the prepared tray, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for another 2-3 hrs, or in the fridge overnight until doubled in size. The lightness of the doughnuts depends on thissecond proving, and a longer prove in the fridge will give the doughnuts more flavour.",
      "Fill a deep-fat fryer following manufacturer\u2019s instructions, or a heavy-based pan, ensuring it is no more than a third full. Heat to 170C or until a cube of bread dropped in browns in 30 seconds. Carefully lift two or three doughnuts from the tray and slide them into the hot oil using a floured spatula. Fry for 2 mins each side until puffed up and golden brown, then remove to a sheet of kitchen paper using a slotted spoon or tongs. Leave to cool. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts, then fry all the mini bites for a total of 2 mins.",
      "When the doughnuts and bites have cooled, you can either coat them in sugar or a glaze. For sugar doughnuts, combine the sugar and cinnamon, then toss with the doughnuts. For glazed doughnuts, sift the icing sugar into a bowl and mix in 2 tbsp cold water until you have a runny icing. Dip in the doughnuts, then decorate with the toppings of your choice. Best eaten straightaway, but will keep in an airtight container for a day."

      "Heat a large saucepan, tip in the cumin and coriander seeds and toast for a few mins until you can smell their fragrance and they turn a shade darker, then tip into a pestle and mortar. Add the oil to the pan, then tip in the onions and cook slowly until golden and caramelised \u2013 this will take 15-20 mins. Meanwhile, bring 2 pans of water to the boil. Add the lentils to 1 pan and cook for 20 mins. Put the rice and a pinch of salt in the other pan and cook for 5 mins (it should still have a little bite). Drain both pans, and leave the lentils and rice to steam-dry.",
      "Boil the kettle. Stir the garlic into the onions and cook for 1-2 mins over a low heat. Grind the whole spices in the pestle and mortar to a fine powder and add these to the onion mixture. Grate half of the nutmeg and add to the onions with the turmeric and allspice.",
      "Put the spinach in a colander in the sink, pour over a kettle of boiling water, then rinse under cold water. Use your hands to squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Finely chop the spinach and add to the onions with the herbs, lemon zest and juice and the rice, lentils and plenty of seasoning. Leave to cool before stirring through the feta.",
      "To assemble the pie, you\u2019ll need plenty of space on your work surface \u2013 about 1 metre. Unwrap the filo and cover with a damp tea towel. Have your bowls of melted butter and beaten egg to hand, as well as a pastry brush for each. Working quickly, lay 4 sheets of filo end to end, running along the length of your work surface, and butter each piece generously, overlapping each sheet by about 10cm. Top with another 4 sheets, butter well, then repeat with 3 final sheets of filo (save the last one to cover any cracks later on.)",
      "Spoon the rice filling down the centre of the filo, leaving 5cm free on either end. Brush the egg around the edges and tuck the ends in to cover the filling. Starting from one end, roll the filo over the filling, working your way along until you have a long filo sausage. From one end, start to coil the sausage back on itself \u2013 if the pastry cracks, patch it over the hole with your reserved piece of filo. When the coil is complete, slide onto a tray lined with baking parchment, brush the top with beaten egg and sprinkle over the sesame seeds. You can now cover it loosely with cling film and chill for up to 24 hrs.",
      "When you\u2019re ready to bake, heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Place the pie on the middle shelf and bake for 45 mins until golden and crisp. Meanwhile, tip the ingredients for the tomato sauce into a pan, season and bubble for 30 mins until rich and thick.",
      "For the salad, halve the cucumber through the centre, then cut in half lengthways and chop into small cubes. Put in a bowl, add the remaining ingredients and season well. Set aside until ready to serve.",
      "Leave the pie to cool for 20 mins before serving with the sauce, salad and a large bowl of yogurt."

This process is important when making fudge, as it creates small sugar crystals, which give the fudge its lovely smooth and creamy texture.",

Place the cake on a cooling rack over a tray to catch any excess glaze. Evenly coat the cake with the glaze by pouring it slowly into the middle, tilting the cake gently so it flows slowly over the edges. Don\u2019t smooth it with a knife or it will look streaky.

      "\u00bd pack butter (about 125g, salted or unsalted), plus extra for the tin",
      "3 tbsp golden syrup",
      "13 digestive biscuits (about 200g)",
      "100g pack toasted flaked almonds or roasted hazelnuts, chopped (see tip, below)"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Put the dried fruit in a small bowl and pour in just enough brandy or juice to cover. Microwave for 2 mins until steaming, then set aside.",
      "The non-messy way to chop chocolate is to smash it (still wrapped) onto your work surface, then unwrap it down to the foil and snap it (still in foil) into small bits using your fingers. Empty the chocolate into a microwaveable bowl. Add the butter and golden syrup, cover the bowl with cling film and microwave for 2 mins until melted. Set aside.",
      "Meanwhile, line a 20cm square tin with baking parchment, using a little butter to stick it in place. (You can also use foil but it\u2019s more fiddly to peel off later, or cling film if you don\u2019t mind wrinkles on the underside of your cake.)",
      "Take a third, large bowl. Use your fingers to break the biscuits into it. Stir in the nuts, soaked fruit and soaking liquid, then mix everything together. Pour the melted chocolate into the bowl with the biscuits, using a spatula or spoon to scrape out every last bit of chocolate. Mix together until everything is coated in chocolate.",
      "Check the ingredients list to make sure everything is accounted for (it\u2019s surprisingly easy to miss something in this recipe), then tip the chocolate mixture into the tin, pushing well into corners and flattening the top. Put in the fridge (no need to cover) for 4 hrs or overnight until set. To serve, remove from tin, peel away the parchment and cut into 16 squares (any crumbly bits that fall off make tasty samples for the cook). Will keep for up to 1 week in an airtight container in the fridge. Can be frozen for up to 1 month."

Pour over 325g room-temperature water (you\u2019ll get a more accurate amount by weighing the water, but you can also use 325ml, depending on your scales), then use your hands or a spatula to mix until a dough forms. It\u2019s important that you ensure all of the flour is mixed in, including any bits around the side of the bowl. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest for 30 mins.",
      "Sprinkle over the salt, then work it in by stretching the dough over the salt several times until fully incorporated. Tip out onto a lightly floured surface. Use the heel of one hand to stretch the dough while you hold it with your other hand. Then, fold the dough back onto itself, turn it 90 degrees to the left and repeat. Do this for about 5 mins, or until the dough looks shinier and immediately bounces back when rolled into a tight ball or gently poked. Roll the dough into a tight ball, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove at room temperature for 1 hr until doubled in size. Or, for a deeper flavour, transfer to a clean bowl, cover and leave to prove in the fridge overnight until doubled in size. Cold dough is easier to work with, so overnight is best.",
      "When the dough has doubled in size and is light and pillowy, tip it out onto a work surface and knead it a few more times to knock the air out. Gather the dough into a ball and leave to rest for 5 mins. Gently form the dough ball into a tight, rounded shape on the work surface, then tip domed-side down into a proving basket or bowl lined with a clean tea towel. Leave to prove in a warm place for 40 mins-1 hr, or in the fridge for 2-3 hrs until roughly doubled in size.",
      "Put a casserole along with its lid in the oven, then heat the oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. Once the oven is at temperature, remove the casserole. Flip the dough onto a square of baking parchment, slash it using a sharp knife and use the sides of the parchment to carefully lower the dough (still on the parchment) into the hot casserole. Cover with the lid. Bake for 25 mins. Remove the lid and bake for 5-10 mins more until it has a deeply golden, crisp crust and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Cool on a wire rack for 40 mins before slicing. Will keep in an airtight container for up to two days."

Keep it in the fridge (it will stay dormant) and 24 hrs before you want to use it, pour half of it off and feed it with 100g flour and 100g water. Leave it at room temperature and it should become active again. The longer the starter has been dormant, the more times it will need to be refreshed \u2013 the process of pouring off half the starter and replacing it with new flour and water \u2013 to reactivate. If your starter is ready to use, a teaspoonful of the mixture should float in warm water.",

Leave the levain for 8 hrs at room temperature until it becomes active. When ready, a teaspoonful of the mixture should float in warm water.",
      "For the breadPour 600g tepid water into the levain and stir with a rubber spatula to mix together \u2013 don\u2019t worry if there are unmixed bits of levain.

Use the corners of the parchment to lift the loaf into the casserole dish. Cover with the lid and bake for 30 mins, then carefully uncover and continue to bake for another 10 mins (or longer for a darker finish). Carefully lift the bread out of the dish using a spatula, transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool to room temperature before slicing. Repeat with the second loaf."

      "For the vegan buttercream, melt the chocolate in the microwave or a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Leave to cool. Beat the spread and vanilla on high speed in a stand mixer for a few minutes until pale and fluffy. Add the icing sugar gradually, beating on slow to start with, then turning up the speed to max until the mixture is light and creamy. Pour in the cooled chocolate and combine thoroughly, add a splash of plant milk if the icing is very stiff. Chill the buttercream for at least 30 mins before using.",
      "When the cake is completely cool, spread the icing over the top and decorate with the sprinkles, if you like. Keep the cake in the fridge to stay firm, then remove 1 hr before serving. Will keep, covered, in the fridge, for up to three days."

Use a pencil end to make 2 holes in the top of each one \u2013 not too close to the edge. Bake, one tray at a time, for 8-10 mins, remaking each hole when biscuits are just out and still soft. Cool. Un-iced biscuits can be frozen for up to 3 months, or will keep in an airtight container for a week.",

Cut out small circles from leftover icing, brush backs with water and stick onto some of the biscuits. Decorate with icing pens, if you wish, then carefully thread through ribbon or string and hang up your treats."

Add the pears, cover with a lid or a piece of baking parchment, and poach gently for 15 mins until a knife easily slides into a pear. Leave to cool in the liquid.",
      "Now make the sponge. Put the dates and linseeds in a saucepan and add the almond milk. Bring to a gentle simmer, then cook for 2-3 mins until the dates are soft. Pour into a food processer and blitz until smooth. Add the oil and blend again, then scrape into a bowl and set aside to cool a little. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease and line a 20 x 30cm baking tin (a loose -bottomed one if possible) with a strip of baking parchment.",

Mix well, breaking up any lumps of sugar with your fingers, and shaking the bowl a few times to encourage any remaining lumps to come to the surface. Add the date and oil mixture, and stir well. Fold in the chopped pear scraps. Scrape the cake mixture into the tin, then nestle in the pears, standing straight up, so that the bottom halves are covered. Bake for 35-40 mins until the cake is cooked through. Insert a skewer to the centre to check \u2013 it should come out clean. If there is any wet cake mixture on the skewer, return the cake to the oven and bake for 10 mins more, then check again.",
      "Meanwhile, bring the pear poaching liquid back to the boil and simmer until reduced to a glossy syrup. When the pudding is cooked, cool for 5-10 mins, then brush all over with the syrup, saving a little extra to serve alongside, with vegan ice cream, if you like."

Don\u2019t knead the mixture as this will make a heavy scone, and if the mixture seems a little too wet, leave for a few mins, as gluten-free flour requires more liquid than wheat flour. Stamp out rounds using a 7cm floured cutter, then place the scones on the baking tray, spaced apart. You will need to lightly squash the dough trimmings together to give you 8-9 scones in total. Brush the tops of the scones with milk, sprinkle with sugar and bake for 10-12 mins until pale golden. Serve with butter and jam, or push the boat out with clotted cream and strawberries, too.

      "Make the candied orange slices a day ahead if you can. Put the sugar and 300ml water in a medium saucepan and bring to the boil. Reduce to a gentle simmer, add the orange slices and cook for 1 hr-1 hr 10 mins or until the pith is translucent, turning occasionally. Line a baking tray with parchment. Carefully remove the slices from the syrup, place on the prepared tray and set aside to dry (at least 8 hrs) before cutting in half. Reserve the syrup.",
      "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Lightly grease a loaf tin (mine was 900g) with olive oil and line with a strip of baking parchment.",
      "Grind the hazelnuts in a food processor until they resemble coarse breadcrumbs (do not blitz them too much or they will become oily), then add to a bowl along with the orange zest, a pinch of salt and the flour, baking powder and cocoa. Mix together until evenly combined.",
      "Pour the oil and the orange juice into a jug and mix together. Put the eggs and sugar in a tabletop mixer or large bowl and whisk together for 5-10 mins or until the mixture has tripled in volume and holds a ribbon on the surface when the beaters are lifted out. Slowly pour the oil mixture into the egg mixture and fold together until combined.",
      "Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture in 3 or 4 additions, folding together until combined. You can\u2019t sieve this mixture over the eggs because of the hazelnuts, but try not to dump the flour in one place \u2013 you need to be careful and fold the batter to retain its lightness. Once fully combined, pour the batter into the prepared loaf tin and bake for 50-55 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.",
      "Prick the top of the cake all over, then pour over 5 tbsp of the reserved orange syrup. Cool in the tin for 15 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Trim the top of the cake (keep this for a mini trifle) and turn out, cut-side down, onto a serving platter.",
      "To decorate, pour the orange juice into a small pan and bring to a simmer. Put the chocolate in a small bowl, pour the orange juice over and stir together to form a smooth ganache. Set aside in the fridge until thickened, about 20-25 mins. Tip the hazelnuts into a small bowl and add the gold powder with a dash of water, stirring together to coat. Put the ganache in a piping bag fitted with a small round piping tip. Pipe in peaks over the top of the cake, decorating with the golden hazelnuts and the orange slices. Will keep for up to 3 days in an airtight container."
