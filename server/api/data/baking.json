Knead the dough for at least 10 mins until it becomes tighter and springy \u2013 if you have a stand mixer you can do this with a dough hook for 5 mins. Pull the dough into a ball and put in a clean, oiled bowl. Leave for 1 hr, or until doubled in size.",
      "Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a long sausage shape. Halve the dough, then divide each half into four pieces, so you have eight equal-sized portions. Roll each into a tight ball and put on a dusted baking tray, leaving some room between each ball for rising. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place to prove for 40 mins-1 hr or until almost doubled in size.",
      "Heat the oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. When the dough is ready, dust each ball with a bit more flour. (If you like, you can glaze the rolls with milk or beaten egg, and top with seeds.) Bake for 25-30mins, until light brown and hollow sounding when tapped on the base. Leave to cool on a wire rack."

Then mix in enough of the remaining water and a bit more if needed, to gather up any dry bits in the bottom of the bowl, until the mixture comes together as a soft, not too sticky, dough. Gather it into a ball with your hands.",

Place the ball of dough on a lightly floured work surface. Cover with an upturned, clean, large glass bowl and leave for 45 mins-1 hr or until doubled in size and feels light and springy. Timing will depend on the warmth of the room.",

Put the risen bread in the oven, carefully pour about 250ml cold water into the roasting tin (this will hiss and create a burst of steam to give you a crisp crust), then lower the heat to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Bake for 20 mins or until golden. Remove and cool on a wire rack. If you tap the underneath of the loaf if should be firm and sound hollow. When baked, drizzle with a little extra olive oil."

Get an adult to put them in the oven for you and bake for 20-25 mins until golden and melty. Ask an adult to remove them from the oven, then leave to cool. The cheese roll-ups will keep for up to 3 days in an airtight container."

      "small bunch parsley, finely chopped (leave a little leftover to garnish, if you like)"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Tip the flour into a large bowl or the bowl of a freestanding mixer. Add the yeast and sugar to one side of the bowl and 1 tsp fine salt to the other. Mix together, then add the melted butter and 275ml warm water. Mix to a dough, then knead for 10 mins by hand (or 5 mins in a freestanding mixer) until the dough feels stretchy and soft. Clean out the bowl, then lightly grease with a little oil. Turn the dough over in the oiled bowl until it\u2019s well coated. Cover with cling film or a tea towel and set aside somewhere warm until the dough has doubled in size. Alternatively, put the dough in the fridge and leave to rise slowly for 2 days (bring it to room temperature before continuing to step 2).",
      "Line your largest baking sheet with parchment, and dust with polenta or cornmeal. Drain the mozzarella and dry the balls on some kitchen paper. Tip the dough onto your work surface and punch out the air bubbles. To make a Christmas tree shape, you\u2019ll need 23 balls. Tear off lumps of dough, ensuring each one is roughly the same size (if you want to be exact, weigh the dough, divide the weight by 23, then weigh each ball of dough as you break them off).",
      "Shape each piece of dough into a disc and place a ball of mozzarella in the middle. Pull up the sides of the dough to encase the cheese, pinching the dough together to seal. Roll into a ball and place on the baking sheet, sealed-side down, in a tree shape. Leave a little space between each ball, as they will grow when proving. You\u2019re likely to have 2 or 3 balls without mozzarella, so use these pieces of dough for the trunk \u2013 for anyone who doesn\u2019t like cheese. Cover the tray with a sheet of oiled cling film and set aside for 30 mins until almost doubled in size.",
      "While the dough proves, make the tomato dipping sauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the garlic and sizzle for 30 secs until fragrant. Add the tomatoes, oregano, vinegar, sugar and some seasoning. Bubble for 30 mins until the sauce is thick. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.",
      "When the dough is ready, uncover the baking sheet and bake for 20-25 mins until golden brown. Meanwhile, make the garlic butter. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the garlic and sizzle for 1-2 mins until the garlic is a shade darker (but not brown). When the bread is cooked, transfer it to a platter. Stir most of the parsley into the garlic butter and use a pastry brush to brush it all over the bread. Leave it to soak in, then brush on more. Sprinkle over a little extra parsley to garnish, if you like. Reheat the tomato sauce and serve it alongside the bread with any remaining garlic butter."

Place the ball of dough on a lightly floured work surface. Cover with an upturned, clean, large glass bowl and leave for 45 mins-1 hr or until doubled in size and feels light and springy. Timing will depend on the warmth of the room.",

Put the risen bread in the oven, carefully pour about 250ml cold water into the roasting tin (this will hiss and create a burst of steam to give you a crisp crust), then lower the heat to 220C/200C fan/gas 7.

Make a dip in the centre of the flour and pour in almost 300ml hand warm (cool rather than hot) water, with a round-bladed knife. Then mix in enough of the remaining water and a bit more if needed, to gather up any dry bits in the bottom of the bowl and until the mixture comes together as a soft, not too sticky, dough. Gather it into a ball with your hands.",
      "Put the dough on to a very lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 mins until it feels smooth and elastic, only adding the minimum of extra flour if necessary to prevent the dough sticking. Place the ball of dough on a lightly floured work surface. Cover with an upturned, clean, large glass bowl and leave for 45 mins-1 hr or until doubled in size and feels light and springy. Timing will depend on the warmth of the room.",
      "Knock back the dough by lightly kneading just 3-4 times. You only want to knock out any large air bubbles, so too much handling now will lose the dough\u2019s lightness. Shape into a ball. Cover with the glass bowl and leave for 15 mins.",
      "Now shape to make a tin loaf Grease a 1.2-litre capacity loaf tin (about 23 x 13 x 5.5cm) and line the base with baking parchment. Using your knuckles, flatten the dough into a rectangle about 25 x 19cm. Fold both shorter ends into the centre like an envelope, make a \u00bc turn, then flatten again into the same size and roll up very tightly, starting from one of the short ends. Roll the top of the dough in extra seeds and place in the tin with the join underneath, pressing the seeds gently into the dough. Cover with a clean tea towel.

Put the risen bread in the oven, carefully pour about 250ml cold water into the roasting tin (this will hiss and create a burst of steam to give you a crisp crust), then lower the heat to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Bake for about 30 mins or until golden, covering with foil for the last 5 mins if starting to brown too quickly. Leave in the tin for 2-3 mins, then remove and cool on a wire rack.

      "2 tbsp clear honey"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "First, make the honey & almond sponges. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/ gas 4. Grease two 15cm cake tins and line the bases with baking parchment. Using a stand mixer or electric hand mixer, beat the butter, muscovado sugar and 140g honey until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs and yolks, one at a time, beating after each addition until well incorporated. In a clean bowl, whisk together the flour, almonds, baking powder and 1 / 4 tsp salt. Add half the flour mixture to the butter mixture and beat until just combined. Add the vanilla and milk, continuing to beat, then add the remaining flour mixture, beating until just combined. Divide the mixture evenly between the tins and bake for 45-55 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of each cake comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool for 10 mins in their tins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Leave the oven on for the candied almonds.",
      "To make a honey syrup, put 2 tbsp honey and 2 tbsp water in a small saucepan and heat for 1-2 mins or until the honey has dissolved. Set aside.",
      "Make the candied almonds by heating 150ml water and the sugar in a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan with a sugar thermometer attached, and swirl until the sugar has dissolved. Meanwhile, spread the almonds out on a baking sheet and bake in the oven for 10-12 mins until golden brown. Heat the sugar syrup to 119C, turn off the heat and stir in the warm almonds. Keep stirring until the syrup coats the nuts and turns white and crunchy. Tip the almonds back onto the baking sheet and roughly chop half of them.",
      "Next, make the Swiss meringue buttercream. Using a stand mixer or electric hand mixer, beat the butter until pale and fluffy. Put the egg whites and sugar in a clean heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Whisk using a clean electric hand mixer and heat the mixture until the sugar has dissolved (you can check this by feeling some of the egg white between your fingers to check that it isn\u2019t grainy). Remove the bowl from the heat and, using a stand or electric hand mixer, whisk for 10 mins or until the mixture forms stiff peaks and has cooled to room temperature. Add the butter, 1-2 tbsp at a time, and beat until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Beat in the honey and transfer to a piping bag fitted with a 1cm nozzle.",
      "To assemble the cake, level the sponges by cutting off the domed tops and split each sponge in half to create four layers. Fix the bottom layer to a cake board or stand with a splodge of buttercream, brush with the honey syrup and pipe a layer of buttercream on top. Gently press the second layer on top and repeat with the remaining layers. Cover the cake with a thin layer of buttercream, then use a palette knife to scrape the sides clean. Pipe a ring of buttercream blobs around the top, or spread a thick layer with a palette knife. Decorate with the candied almonds."

Bake for 30 mins, then reduce the oven to 150C/130C fan/gas 2 and bake for another 1 hr 45 mins-2 hrs, or until a skewer comes out clean and the cake is well-risen and firm. Carefully remove from the tin and leave to cool completely on a wire rack. Cut into slices to serve. Will keep for two weeks in an airtight container.",
      "Brush the warm apricot jam over the cooled cake. Cut a 200g piece from the remaining marzipan and roll it out again as before. Cut out a 23cm circle using the base of the cake tin as a guide. Use the rolling pin to help you lift the marzipan circle over the cake and gently press it onto the surface (the apricot jam will help it stick). Divide the remaining marzipan into 11 pieces and roll into balls. Use a little more jam to stick the balls around the edge of the cake \u2013 these represent the 12 apostles, minus Judas. If you like, use a kitchen blowtorch to slightly burnish the marzipan balls and topping until just golden (do this carefully so they don't burn)."

Pipe each colour around the ears and horn and all over the top of the cake, coming down one side and over the edge of the front \u2013 this is the unicorn's mane. Decorate with some sprinkles, if using.",

      "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease two 20cm cake tins (one should be at least 8cm deep) with oil, and line the base and sides with baking parchment. Tip the egg yolks, caster sugar and vanilla into a large bowl, and the egg whites into a second large bowl. Combine the flour, almonds and 1 /4 tsp salt in a third bowl.",
      "Using an electric hand whisk, beat the egg whites until doubled in size and holding soft peaks. Transfer the beaters to the egg yolk bowl (no need to clean the beaters first) and whisk until the mixture is thick and pale. Lift the beaters and drizzle the mixture around the bowl \u2013 a ribbon should sit on the surface for 2-3 secs.",
      "With a large metal spoon, transfer a spoonful of egg white to the yolks, and mix to loosen the consistency. Add the remaining whites and gently fold into the yolks, trying to retain as much volume as possible. Stop before the mixture is totally combined. Sprinkle the flour and almond mixture evenly over the surface, then drizzle the cooled butter around the edge of the bowl. Fold everything together until just combined, making sure you scoop the spoon right down to the bottom of the bowl to catch the butter and any pockets of flour. Divide the mixture between the cake tins, level the surfaces, then bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 22-25 mins. Test the cakes are done by inserting a skewer into the centre \u2013 it should come out clean. Cool in their tins on a wire rack for 30 mins, then remove the tins and parchment, and leave to cool completely.",
      "Boil the kettle. Put the gelatine in a bowl of cold water and set aside to soften. Pour 150ml cream and 50ml hot water into a saucepan. Add the matcha powder and whisk over a gentle heat until well combined and steaming. Remove from the heat. Squeeze the water from the gelatine leaves and add them, one by one, to the hot matcha cream, whisking until they\u2019re dissolved. Pour the warm cream into a bowl and put in the fridge to cool to room temperature \u2013 don\u2019t leave it too long or the gelatine will set.",
      "Line the deepest of your 20cm cake tins with a double layer of cling film, ensuring the sides are well covered. Put one of the sponges in the tin, flattest-side down. Pour the remaining 450ml cream into a bowl and add the icing sugar. Whip until the cream is holding soft peaks, then fold through the cooled matcha cream. Scrape the cream into the cake tin and level the surface. Put the remaining sponge on top, flattest-side facing up, pushing the sponge gently into the cream. Wrap the tin in cling film and chill for at least 4 hrs.",
      "Put the cream, chocolate and matcha powder in a saucepan and heat very gently, stirring until the chocolate has melted and the matcha is well mixed in. Set aside to cool and thicken for 10 mins. Remove the cake from the fridge and unwrap the tin. Invert the cake onto a cake stand or plate and remove from the tin and the cling film. Using a palette knife held at a 90-degree angle to the side of the cake, scrape around the edge to remove any excess mousse and give the cake a smooth finish. Using baking parchment, create a tight collar, sitting about 2cm taller than the cake. Pour the cooled chocolate glaze over the top, smoothing it to the edge \u2013 the collar should prevent it from dribbling down the sides. Chill for 30 mins more, or for up to 24 hrs.",
      "Carefully pull off the parchment collar. Hold a chopping board (or another object with a straight edge) over half the cake and dust the exposed surface with icing sugar. Arrange fresh cherries and cherry blossom or another edible flower on top, if you like, and serve immediately."

Pour each coloured sponge mix into separate tins and smooth over the tops. Bake for 25-30 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.

      "While the cake is cooling, make the icing. Beat together the icing sugar and butter until pale and fluffy, mixing in 1 tbsp warm water to loosen the mixture if necessary. Set half of the icing aside in a bowl. Divide the other half of the icing between three bowls and colour each a different shade of blue, a dark, medium and light. Stack the sponges, spreading most of the white icing over each one using a palette knife, then use the palette knife to roughly coat the outside of the cakes with the remaining white icing to create a crumb coat. Chill for 30 mins.",
      "Put each of the blue icing shades in separate piping bags and cut a large 2cm hole at the bottom. Starting with the dark shade at the bottom of the cake, pipe an even ring onto the whole cake, two-three times around. Continue working your way up the cake with the icing getting lighter as you reach the top of the cake. Using a small palette knife, work your way around the join in between each row, gently pushing to join each line together. Save some icing in the piping bags to decorate the top. Smooth over the cake with a large palette knife or cake scraper to create a smooth ombre icing, keeping the excess to decorate the top.",
      "You can either mix all the leftover icing together and put in a clean piping bag with a star nozzle to get a multicoloured effect, or pipe individual shades on the top. Add a few dots around the top of the cake in the varying blue colours to look like waves (using some of the white to look like the top of a crashing wave), and dot around the pearls, sprinkles, shells and mermaid tails, pushing them into the icing on the side of the cake, and on top to finish."

      "First make the malt sponges. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease and line the bases of 2 x 20cm cake tins with baking parchment. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl and whisk until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking well between each addition. Tip the flour, malt and baking powder into the bowl with \u00bc tsp salt and fold together, then add the yogurt and vanilla, and give everything a final stir.

Cool for 10 mins, then remove from the tins, peel off the baking parchment and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Wash the tins.",
      "Now make the chocolate sponges. Grease and line the base of the tins as before and boil the kettle. In the same bowl (don\u2019t worry about washing it), cream the butter and sugar as before, adding the eggs, one at a time, and mixing until combined. Sift in the flour, cocoa and baking powder with \u00bc tsp salt. Fold the mixture together, then add the yogurt, melted chocolate and 100ml boiling water. Stir until combined, then divide between the tins. Bake for 25-30 mins, testing with a skewer as before. Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out, remove the baking parchment and cool completely. The sponges can be made up to 2 days before being iced, cooled and wrapped tightly in cling film.",
      "Make the honeycomb. Grease a baking tray with a little butter or oil. Put the sugar and golden syrup in a large pan. Warm over a medium heat and leave to bubble to a liquid caramel, but don\u2019t stir. When you\u2019re happy with the colour (the darker it gets, the more intense the flavour will be), add the bicarbonate of soda and quickly stir into the syrup. Before the bubbles die down, pour the foaming mixture onto the baking tray, then set aside for 30 mins to cool and firm up.",
      "Make the icing. In your largest mixing bowl, beat the butter with half the icing sugar, the malt and vanilla until smooth. Add the remaining icing sugar and the cream cheese, and beat again until well combined \u2013 don\u2019t overmix or the icing may become runny.",
      "You\u2019re now ready to assemble. Put one of the sponges on a cake stand or cake board, sticking it down with a small blob of icing. Use \u00bc of the icing to stack the cakes, alternating between the malt and chocolate sponges. Place the final sponge on top, flat-side up. When assembled, use a palette knife to cover the entire cake with a thin layer of the icing, filling any gaps between sponges, but don\u2019t worry about completely covering the sponges at this stage. This is called a crumb coat and ensures that your final layer is crumb-free. Make space in your fridge and chill the cake for 30 mins to firm up the icing.",
      "Once the icing is chilled, use the remaining icing to completely cover the cake. This is easiest if you pile the icing on top of the cake, then use a palette knife to ease it over the edge and down the sides. You can make it as smooth or as rough as you like. Chill for another 30 mins.",
      "Make the drizzle. Meanwhile, put the dark chocolate in a bowl and heat the cream in a small pan until just steaming. Pour the cream over the chocolate and leave to melt for 5-10 mins. Stir to make a glossy ganache, then set aside to firm up a little \u2013 you want the ganache to be pourable but not too runny, to make drizzly droplets down the side of the cake.",
      "When the ganache is the correct consistency, remove the cake from the fridge and spoon the ganache over the top edge of the cake, encouraging it to drizzle down the side with your spoon \u2013 start at the back of the cake to get the hang of it. Fill in the middle of the top of the cake with chocolate too.",
      "Break the honeycomb into tall shards and stack them on top of the cake. Finish with whole and halved Maltesers, adding a few around the base, along with some honeycomb crumbs. The cake is best served within 2-3 hrs of assembling, but will still taste delicious for up to 3 days. Store leftovers in the fridge and allow to come back to room temperature before serving."

Whisk until smooth and pale pink and place in the fridge until needed. Repeat the process with the lemon buttercream.",

    "steps": [
      "Start by making the cake. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly grease a 23cm deep round cake pan, lining the base with parchment paper.",
      "Cream the butter and sugar together in a large bowl using an electric hand whisk until light and fluffy \u2013 this should take about 10 mins. Add the vanilla and whisk again to combine. Beat the eggs a little with a fork, and with the beaters still running, add the eggs a little bit at a time. Wait until each addition has been fully combined before adding more.",
      "Once all of the eggs have been added, fold in the flour with a spatula in three additions, alternating with the yogurt. If the finished batter feels a little stiff, mix in a couple tbsp of milk to loosen it. Transfer the batter into the prepared cake pan and level out with a spatula.",
      "Bake in the preheated oven for about 1 hr 30 \u2013 1 hr 40 mins or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. If the cake is browning too quickly, cover loosely with baking parchment for the last 15 mins of cooking. Allow the cake to cool in the tin for 20 mins.",
      "While the cake is cooling in the tin make the syrup. Place the sugar, 50ml water and vanilla extract into a small saucepan over a medium heat and bring to a simmer, cooking for a few mins until the sugar has dissolved. Transfer the cake onto a wire rack to cool completely then use a skewer to poke holes all over the top of the cake. Use a pastry brush to spread the syrup over the top of the cake, allowing it to soak into the sponge before adding more.",
      "To make the buttercream, beat the butter and icing sugar together with an electric hand whisk until light and fluffy, then add the orange curd and whisk again to combine. If the cake is domed on the top, use a large serrated knife to level it off then cut the cake through the middle, into two layers. Place the bottom layer of cake onto a 23cm round cake board and spread a thin layer of buttercream on the cake and top with the raspberry jam. Place the second layer of cake on top and spread the remaining buttercream over the top and sides of the cake.",
      "On a work surface lightly dusted with icing sugar, knead the red sugarpaste until soft and pliable. Roll it out until about 3-4mm thick and wide enough to cover the cake. Roll the sugarpaste onto the rolling pin and carefully drape over the cake. Gently smooth the sugarpaste down the sides of the cake and trim off the excess with a small sharp knife. Reserve the trimmings for the details later on.",
      "Repeat the rolling process with the yellow sugarpaste but this time cutting into thin strips. Cut 30 strips approx 1.5cm x 10cm and stick to the sides of the cake all the way around, dipping your finger in water to brush onto the back of each one, which will act as glue (the strips should cover the entire height of the cake but only reach a couple of centimetres over the top of cake).",
      "Next roll out the blue sugarpaste to the same thickness as the red and yellow but this time cut out a 20cm circle and stick it in place in the middle of the cake using a little water. Roll out the brown sugarpaste as well and use a thin sharp knife to cut out Duggee\u2019s face and attach to the blue circle.",
      "For Duggee\u2019s clothes knead a little yellow into the remaining brown sugarpaste until it is a light brown colour and use this to cut out his shirt and lip area, sticking with a little water as before. Use the black sugarpaste to roll his eyes and nose, using your hands rather than rolling on the work surface. Use the remaining sugarpaste to shape the decorations for his outfit and mouth and stick as before with a little water. Wrap the ribbon around the bottom edge of the cake and secure with tape or a pin but remember to remove before serving. This cake will keep in a sealed container for up to 4 days."

Flip onto a wire rack and remove the baking parchment. Leave to cool. Can now be covered with cling film and kept for up to 5 days.",
      "To make the buttercream, put the ingredients in a large bowl and mash together with a fork or spatula (this prevents the icing sugar from going everywhere). When roughly combined, blend with an electric hand whisk until smooth.",
      "Now make the marshmallow icing. Put the egg whites, sugar, 1 tbsp water and a good pinch of salt into a heatproof bowl. Place over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the hot water, and whisk until thick and leaving a prominent trail from the beaters \u2013 this will take about 4 mins. Remove the bowl from the heat and continue whisking for another 3 mins until cooled slightly and really stiff. Transfer half to a piping bag fitted with a large round nozzle and set aside.",
      "When ready to assemble, slice the cake lengthways into 3 even layers. On a cake stand or plate, reassemble the cake, with the largest slice on the bottom, layering with the buttercream.",
      "Using a small offset palette knife or small butter knife, cover the cake with the marshmallow icing left in the bowl. Use the palette knife to create vertical lines along the edges (see tip, left). Now use the piping bag to pipe spikes of meringue over the top of the cake. Use a cook\u2019s blowtorch to toast the meringue to a golden brown \u2013 a few charred patches will add to the effect. Serve straight away or chill for up to 2 days, removing from the fridge 30 mins before serving. We decorated ours with sparklers."

Next, divide the remaining white fondant into two pieces. Roll each one out into a rough oval on a sheet of baking parchment, then pinch the top end of each oval upwards to make a point.

Sift in the flour, baking powder and a pinch of salt, and fold in using a large metal spoon. Add just enough of the milk to create a soft dropping consistency.",

Using a small paintbrush, paint the unicorn horn gold using the paste, as well as the inside of the ears, if you like. Carefully place the gold horn in the middle of the iced cake, with the ears on either side.",

Pipe each colour around the ears and horn and all over the top of the cake, coming down one side and over the edge of the front \u2013 this is the unicorn's mane. Decorate with some sprinkles, if using.",

Colour one of the batters blue and another pink, starting with a little colouring, then adding more for a deeper finish. Leave one of the bowls of batter uncoloured.",
      "Get the three cake tins and bowls of batter ready in front of you. Spoon a heaped tablespoon of blue batter into the centre of the first tin, then pink in the second, and plain in the third. Working quickly so that it doesn\u2019t spread too much, add another dollop of a different coloured batter on top of each one. Don\u2019t wait for the batter to settle or spread, just keep alternating the colours until you run out. The weight of each layer will cause the batter to spread as you go, so very gently tap and shake the cake tins to even out the mixture, then bake in the centre of the oven for 25-30 mins or until firm to the touch. Turn out top-side down onto wire racks straightaway, then leave to cool completely.",
      "For the icing, put the butter, icing sugar and vanilla seeds into a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or put in a bowl and use an electric whisk. Beat for 5 mins or until fluffy and aerated. Add the cream cheese and beat briefly until just combined.",
      "Place one of the cakes on a cake stand or serving plate and spread 2 tbsp of the buttercream on top, then repeat with the other sponges. Spread a smooth layer of the icing over the top and sides of the cake, using a large palette knife, leaving some slightly less iced spots for a \u2018naked\u2019 finish. Top with sprinkles and candles, if you like. Will keep in an airtight tin for three days."

      "1 round chocolate"

      "Weigh 250g into the loaf tin, then spoon the rest of the mixture into the pudding basin.",
      "Cook both cakes side by side in the oven. The loaf cake will cook in about 30 mins and the basin cake in about 1 hour. Take the loaf cake out of the oven and close the oven door quickly so as not to allow the heat out. Test with a skewer inserted into the centre, it should come out clean. If not return to the oven for another five mins. Repeat with the basin cake after about another half an hour. Once each cake is cooked, allow to cool completely before turning out.",
      "To make the icing, mix together the cocoa and water to make a smooth paste. Beat the butter until soft and gradually beat in the icing sugar. Add the cocoa paste and beat until smooth.",
      "To assemble the cake, trim the top of the basin cake so it is flat. Turn cut side down onto a board and cut in half vertically. Spread a little butter icing on each of the flat bases and sandwich these two buttercreamed surfaces together to make a rugby ball shape for the hedgehog body. Place onto a 30cm cake board or wooden board. Cut the loaf cake in half vertically. Take one half and trim the short end to a v shape to make the pointy head. Use a little icing to attach to the body. Cut pieces from the remaining loaf cake to fill any gaps. Cover the whole cake in butter icing.",
      "Cut the flake bars into pieces ranging from 2.5cm to 5cm. The spikes do not have to be regular or even in shape. Starting at the front push the spikes into the body of the hedgehog at a slight angle. Start with the small pieces gradually using larger ones as you go towards the back. Press a round chocolate into the tip of the head to represent the nose and use chocolate chips for the eyes. Using a tiny bit of butter icing attach sliver or gold balls to the eyes.",
      "The cake is best made the day before cutting and icing and will keep well for 3\u20134 days."

Using electric beaters, beat the butter and remaining sugar in a large bowl until light and creamy and the sugar has dissolved. Gradually beat in the egg yolks and cooled chocolate. Fold about \u2153 the whisked egg whites into the chocolate mixture. Sift the flour over the mixture in two batches and fold each in. Gently fold in the remaining beaten egg whites using a spatula.",
      "Pour the cake batter into the prepared tin, spread evenly and bake for about 1 hr or until the cake is risen and springy to the touch. Put on a wire rack and leave to cool completely in the tin.",

Loosen the bottom of the cake tin, then slide off the tin and peel away the baking parchment. Halve the base horizontally. Place the bottom layer on a cake stand and spread with half of the jam mixture, then place the other half of the cake on top. Spread a thin layer of the remaining jam all over the cake and leave to dry.",
      "For the chocolate glaze, bring 40ml water and sugar to the boil in a small saucepan until the sugar has dissolved. Leave to cool slightly, then stir in 2 tbsp of the double cream. Heat the remaining cream in a separate pan and stir in the butter until melted. Remove from the heat and gradually add the chocolate, letting it melt into the cream, and stir in the sugar syrup. Place the cake on a cooling rack over a tray to catch any excess glaze. Evenly coat the cake with the glaze by pouring it slowly into the middle, tilting the cake gently so it flows slowly over the edges. Don\u2019t smooth it with a knife or it will look streaky. Best enjoyed fresh but will keep for up to three days.",

Pour the melted chocolate into a small piping bag and pipe onto the still-damp icing in parallel strips, 2-3cm apart. Carefully pull the tip of a spoon alternately from top to bottom through the lines to make the pattern, then allow the glaze to dry."

Put in the fridge (no need to cover) for 4 hrs or overnight until set. To serve, remove from tin, peel away the parchment and cut into 16 squares (any crumbly bits that fall off make tasty samples for the cook). Will keep for up to 1 week in an airtight container in the fridge. Can be frozen for up to 1 month."

(Alternatively, melt in the microwave, stirring the chocolate every 20 secs so it doesn\u2019t burn.) Remove the bowl from the heat and leave to cool a little. Meanwhile, put the butter and icing sugar in another large bowl and mash with a spatula to combine (this will prevent you covering the work surface in icing sugar), then whisk with a hand mixer until smooth.

    "steps": [
      "First make the malt sponges. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease and line the bases of 2 x 20cm cake tins with baking parchment. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl and whisk until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking well between each addition. Tip the flour, malt and baking powder into the bowl with \u00bc tsp salt and fold together, then add the yogurt and vanilla, and give everything a final stir. Divide the cake mixture between the 2 tins, level the tops and bake on the middle shelf for 25-30 mins or until a skewer pushed into the centre of the cakes comes out clean. Cool for 10 mins, then remove from the tins, peel off the baking parchment and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Wash the tins.",
      "Now make the chocolate sponges. Grease and line the base of the tins as before and boil the kettle. In the same bowl (don\u2019t worry about washing it), cream the butter and sugar as before, adding the eggs, one at a time, and mixing until combined. Sift in the flour, cocoa and baking powder with \u00bc tsp salt. Fold the mixture together, then add the yogurt, melted chocolate and 100ml boiling water. Stir until combined, then divide between the tins. Bake for 25-30 mins, testing with a skewer as before. Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out, remove the baking parchment and cool completely. The sponges can be made up to 2 days before being iced, cooled and wrapped tightly in cling film.",
      "Make the honeycomb. Grease a baking tray with a little butter or oil. Put the sugar and golden syrup in a large pan. Warm over a medium heat and leave to bubble to a liquid caramel, but don\u2019t stir. When you\u2019re happy with the colour (the darker it gets, the more intense the flavour will be), add the bicarbonate of soda and quickly stir into the syrup. Before the bubbles die down, pour the foaming mixture onto the baking tray, then set aside for 30 mins to cool and firm up.",
      "Make the icing. In your largest mixing bowl, beat the butter with half the icing sugar, the malt and vanilla until smooth. Add the remaining icing sugar and the cream cheese, and beat again until well combined \u2013 don\u2019t overmix or the icing may become runny.",
      "You\u2019re now ready to assemble. Put one of the sponges on a cake stand or cake board, sticking it down with a small blob of icing. Use \u00bc of the icing to stack the cakes, alternating between the malt and chocolate sponges. Place the final sponge on top, flat-side up. When assembled, use a palette knife to cover the entire cake with a thin layer of the icing, filling any gaps between sponges, but don\u2019t worry about completely covering the sponges at this stage. This is called a crumb coat and ensures that your final layer is crumb-free. Make space in your fridge and chill the cake for 30 mins to firm up the icing.",
      "Once the icing is chilled, use the remaining icing to completely cover the cake. This is easiest if you pile the icing on top of the cake, then use a palette knife to ease it over the edge and down the sides. You can make it as smooth or as rough as you like. Chill for another 30 mins.",
      "Make the drizzle. Meanwhile, put the dark chocolate in a bowl and heat the cream in a small pan until just steaming. Pour the cream over the chocolate and leave to melt for 5-10 mins. Stir to make a glossy ganache, then set aside to firm up a little \u2013 you want the ganache to be pourable but not too runny, to make drizzly droplets down the side of the cake.",
      "When the ganache is the correct consistency, remove the cake from the fridge and spoon the ganache over the top edge of the cake, encouraging it to drizzle down the side with your spoon \u2013 start at the back of the cake to get the hang of it. Fill in the middle of the top of the cake with chocolate too.",
      "Break the honeycomb into tall shards and stack them on top of the cake. Finish with whole and halved Maltesers, adding a few around the base, along with some honeycomb crumbs. The cake is best served within 2-3 hrs of assembling, but will still taste delicious for up to 3 days. Store leftovers in the fridge and allow to come back to room temperature before serving."

      "To make the buttercream, beat the butter and icing sugar together using an electric mixer or by hand (start off gently or the icing sugar will fly everywhere), until pale and light, but don\u2019t beat for so long that it gets too fluffy. Add the lime zest and beat again until smooth. Chill in the fridge until the buttercream is firm, but spreadable.",

Tip the pan if you need to combine patches of sugar that haven\u2019t melted into the liquid parts, but don\u2019t be tempted to stir. When you have a medium amber-coloured caramel, sprinkle on the spices and lemon juice. Turn the heat off.",

When the squash is all in the pan, turn the heat on again and cook until the caramel starts to bubble. Turn the heat down and cook for about 10-15 mins, making sure the caramel doesn\u2019t burn. You want the squash to give off any water and then to start absorbing the caramel \u2013 the caramel will start to get very liquid as this happens, so turn the heat up at the end and make sure the caramel thickens up completely. Turn the heat off, drop the butter into the centre of the pan and wait for it to melt.",

Bake for 20 mins, then turn the heat down to 160C/140C fan/gas 3 and bake for a further 20 mins. Turn out onto a plate while the tarte is hot so the squash and caramel release easily. Serve with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche or ice cream."

      "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Roll the pastry out to about 1cm thick, then grate over a dusting of nutmeg using a fine grater. Fold the dough in half, then roll out again, to the thickness of 2 x \u00a31 coins and large enough to line a 20cm loose-bottomed sandwich tin with some overhang. Press the pastry into the tin (leaving the excess draped over the sides), put onto a baking sheet and chill for 10 mins. Line the pastry with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake for 20 mins, then remove beans and paper. Bake for another 15 mins until golden and sandy all over. Trim the edges of the tart with a sharp serrated knife.",
      "Turn oven down to 150C/130C fan/ gas 2. Whisk together the eggs and sugar in a large bowl. Put the cream, milk, vanilla pod and seeds into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Pour onto the eggs, whisking as you go. Sieve into a jug. Put the baking sheet onto the pulled-out oven rack, then pour in the custard, right to the top. You may not need every last drop. Grate over a nice layer of nutmeg, then slide gently back into the oven and bake for 1 hr. When it\u2019s ready, the tart should be set and pale golden on the top, and have just the merest tremor in the centre when you jiggle the tray. Cool completely, then serve in slices."

Put in the fridge (no need to cover) for 4 hrs or overnight until set. To serve, remove from tin, peel away the parchment and cut into 16 squares (any crumbly bits that fall off make tasty samples for the cook).

      "ready-to-roll fondant icing, coloured (we used a mixture of blue and green food colouring), or an icing writing pen"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease and line two 20cm cake tins with baking parchment \u2013 if your cake tins are quite shallow, line the sides to a depth of at least 5cm. Put 200g flour, 8 tbsp cocoa powder, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda, 280g light brown soft sugar and 1 tsp salt in a bowl and mix well. If there are any lumps in the sugar, squeeze these through your fingers to break them up.",
      "Measure 200ml buttermilk, 100ml coffee, 150ml oil and 2 tsp vanilla in a jug. Add 2 eggs and whisk until smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk until well combined. Pour the cake mixture evenly into the two tins, and bake for 25-30 mins until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool.",
      "Repeat steps 1 and 2, so that you have 4 sponge cakes in total. These sponges can be made up to three days ahead and will stay moist if wrapped in cling film, or you can wrap well and freeze for up to two months.",
      "To make the icing, put the butter in a large bowl and sieve in half the icing sugar. Roughly mash together with a spatula, then whizz with a hand mixer until smooth. Add the cream cheese and sieve in the remaining icing sugar, mash together again, then blend once more with the hand mixer. Put the biscuits in a food processor and whizz to fine crumbs. Add the biscuit crumbs to the icing and mix again until combined.",
      "Next, make the cookie cake toppers. You\u2019ll need one biscuit for each letter of the word you\u2019d like to write \u2013 someone\u2019s name or, like we have done, \u2018WOW!\u2019 Carefully insert a skewer into the creamy filling in the middle of each biscuit \u2013 some cookies may break, so save these ones for later. Melt the chocolate in the microwave, stirring every 20 secs or so, or in a heatproof bowl suspended over a pan of gently simmering water. Spread a little chocolate over the surface of one side of each cookie. Roll out the fondant icing to the thickness of a 50p coin, and cut out your letters, then stick these to the cookies and set aside to dry. Alternatively, let the chocolate dry, then use an icing pen to write the name or word directly on the surface.",
      "To assemble the cake, stick one of your sponges to a cake stand or board with a little of the cream cheese icing. Use roughly half the icing to stack the remaining cakes on top, spreading a generous amount between each layer. Pile the remaining icing on top of the assembled cake, and use a palette knife to ease it over the edges, covering the entire surface of the cake. Tidy the plate with a piece of kitchen paper.",
      "If you have any leftover biscuits, break them into pieces and push these around the base of the cake. Insert the dried cookie cake toppers into the top of the cake and serve. Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 2 days, but bring back to room temperature for an hour or so before eating."

    "steps": [
      "First make the malt sponges. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Grease and line the bases of 2 x 20cm cake tins with baking parchment. Put the butter and sugar in a large bowl and whisk until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking well between each addition. Tip the flour, malt and baking powder into the bowl with \u00bc tsp salt and fold together, then add the yogurt and vanilla, and give everything a final stir. Divide the cake mixture between the 2 tins, level the tops and bake on the middle shelf for 25-30 mins or until a skewer pushed into the centre of the cakes comes out clean. Cool for 10 mins, then remove from the tins, peel off the baking parchment and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Wash the tins.",
      "Now make the chocolate sponges. Grease and line the base of the tins as before and boil the kettle. In the same bowl (don\u2019t worry about washing it), cream the butter and sugar as before, adding the eggs, one at a time, and mixing until combined. Sift in the flour, cocoa and baking powder with \u00bc tsp salt. Fold the mixture together, then add the yogurt, melted chocolate and 100ml boiling water. Stir until combined, then divide between the tins. Bake for 25-30 mins, testing with a skewer as before. Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out, remove the baking parchment and cool completely. The sponges can be made up to 2 days before being iced, cooled and wrapped tightly in cling film.",
      "Make the honeycomb. Grease a baking tray with a little butter or oil. Put the sugar and golden syrup in a large pan. Warm over a medium heat and leave to bubble to a liquid caramel, but don\u2019t stir. When you\u2019re happy with the colour (the darker it gets, the more intense the flavour will be), add the bicarbonate of soda and quickly stir into the syrup. Before the bubbles die down, pour the foaming mixture onto the baking tray, then set aside for 30 mins to cool and firm up.",
      "Make the icing. In your largest mixing bowl, beat the butter with half the icing sugar, the malt and vanilla until smooth. Add the remaining icing sugar and the cream cheese, and beat again until well combined \u2013 don\u2019t overmix or the icing may become runny.",
      "You\u2019re now ready to assemble. Put one of the sponges on a cake stand or cake board, sticking it down with a small blob of icing. Use \u00bc of the icing to stack the cakes, alternating between the malt and chocolate sponges. Place the final sponge on top, flat-side up. When assembled, use a palette knife to cover the entire cake with a thin layer of the icing, filling any gaps between sponges, but don\u2019t worry about completely covering the sponges at this stage. This is called a crumb coat and ensures that your final layer is crumb-free. Make space in your fridge and chill the cake for 30 mins to firm up the icing.",
      "Once the icing is chilled, use the remaining icing to completely cover the cake. This is easiest if you pile the icing on top of the cake, then use a palette knife to ease it over the edge and down the sides. You can make it as smooth or as rough as you like. Chill for another 30 mins.",
      "Make the drizzle. Meanwhile, put the dark chocolate in a bowl and heat the cream in a small pan until just steaming. Pour the cream over the chocolate and leave to melt for 5-10 mins. Stir to make a glossy ganache, then set aside to firm up a little \u2013 you want the ganache to be pourable but not too runny, to make drizzly droplets down the side of the cake.",
      "When the ganache is the correct consistency, remove the cake from the fridge and spoon the ganache over the top edge of the cake, encouraging it to drizzle down the side with your spoon \u2013 start at the back of the cake to get the hang of it. Fill in the middle of the top of the cake with chocolate too.",
      "Break the honeycomb into tall shards and stack them on top of the cake. Finish with whole and halved Maltesers, adding a few around the base, along with some honeycomb crumbs. The cake is best served within 2-3 hrs of assembling, but will still taste delicious for up to 3 days. Store leftovers in the fridge and allow to come back to room temperature before serving."

Put them in a pan and cover with water, then bring to the boil. Cook for 1 min, then drain and rinse. Dry and set aside. Juice the limes and add enough water to make 225ml. Heat gently with the sugar until the sugar has melted. Add the strips of zest and simmer until the liquid has almost evaporated and turned syrupy \u2013 about 30 mins. Scoop the strips of zest out with a slotted spoon, then place them on parchment to dry.",
      "To make the buttercream, beat the butter and icing sugar together using an electric mixer or by hand (start off gently or the icing sugar will fly everywhere), until pale and light, but don\u2019t beat for so long that it gets too fluffy. Add the lime zest and beat again until smooth. Chill in the fridge until the buttercream is firm, but spreadable.",
      "To make the icing, heat the cream gently (don't let it boil), then take it off the heat. Add the chocolate and let it melt, stirring to help it along. Put the marmalade in a small pan with the extra 1 tbsp cream and heat slowly to dissolve. Add to the chocolate and cream and stir until everything is blended.

Meanwhile crush the remaining raspberries until juicy and mix with the icing sugar to make a thick icing. Spread thinly over the pies and sprinkle with freeze dried raspberries or sprinkles, if you like. Eat warm, or cold, for breakfast or drizzle with cream or custard for dessert."

You can speed this up by putting it in the fridge \u2013 just stir it every 5 mins or so to prevent the chocolate from setting.",
      "Push a skewer into the centre of the cake and slip the straw over the top \u2013 this will give it more stability. Push 1-2cm of the straw into the cake. Use a cutlery knife to spread a blob of chocolate onto a sugar coated chocolate sweet and, starting at the base, stick the sweets to the straw. You will have to do this in stages to allow the chocolate to set a little before adding another layer of sweets. Work your way up the straw until it\u2019s completely covered. If the chocolate in your bowl becomes too firm, simply heat again until it is at the correct consistency. Stop when you reach the bend in the straw.",
      "Stick the remaining skewer into the top of the straw so that it pokes out at an angle. Place the paper bag on top \u2013 you may have to use a little sticky tape to hold it in place. If any of the straw is exposed, cover it with more sweets.",

    ],
    "steps": [
      "If you're making the mermaid tails, melt the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl in 20-second bursts in the microwave, stirring after each turn. Pour into the tail moulds and small shells, and put on a small tray flat in the freezer for 15-20 mins until set. You can repeat this for four tails if you only have one mould.",
      "Once set, remove from the mould, mix the lustre with \u00bc tsp of water and paint it onto the mermaid tails (see tip, below). Put back on a plate or tray in the freezer until needed.",
      "Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter and line the base of three 18cm sandwich cake tins with baking parchment. Using a stand mixer or electric hand whisk, beat together the butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla, baking powder and flour until you have a fluffy mix.",
      "Divide the mixture evenly between three bowls and mix a few drops of colouring into each bowl until fully combined, making each bowl a different shade of purple, getting lighter. Pour each coloured sponge mix into separate tins and smooth over the tops. Bake for 25-30 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. After 10 mins, remove the cakes from their tins and transfer to a cooling rack, top-side facing down, and leave to cool. Don\u2019t worry if the outside doesn\u2019t look purple, the inside will!",
      "While the cake is cooling, make the icing. Beat together the icing sugar and butter until pale and fluffy, mixing in 1 tbsp warm water to loosen the mixture if necessary. Set half of the icing aside in a bowl. Divide the other half of the icing between three bowls and colour each a different shade of blue, a dark, medium and light. Stack the sponges, spreading most of the white icing over each one using a palette knife, then use the palette knife to roughly coat the outside of the cakes with the remaining white icing to create a crumb coat. Chill for 30 mins.",
      "Put each of the blue icing shades in separate piping bags and cut a large 2cm hole at the bottom. Starting with the dark shade at the bottom of the cake, pipe an even ring onto the whole cake, two-three times around. Continue working your way up the cake with the icing getting lighter as you reach the top of the cake. Using a small palette knife, work your way around the join in between each row, gently pushing to join each line together. Save some icing in the piping bags to decorate the top. Smooth over the cake with a large palette knife or cake scraper to create a smooth ombre icing, keeping the excess to decorate the top.",
      "You can either mix all the leftover icing together and put in a clean piping bag with a star nozzle to get a multicoloured effect, or pipe individual shades on the top. Add a few dots around the top of the cake in the varying blue colours to look like waves (using some of the white to look like the top of a crashing wave), and dot around the pearls, sprinkles, shells and mermaid tails, pushing them into the icing on the side of the cake, and on top to finish."

      "Cook both cakes side by side in the oven. The loaf cake will cook in about 30 mins and the basin cake in about 1 hour. Take the loaf cake out of the oven and close the oven door quickly so as not to allow the heat out. Test with a skewer inserted into the centre, it should come out clean.

      "To make the icing, mix together the cocoa and water to make a smooth paste. Beat the butter until soft and gradually beat in the icing sugar. Add the cocoa paste and beat until smooth.",
      "To assemble the cake, trim the top of the basin cake so it is flat. Turn cut side down onto a board and cut in half vertically. Spread a little butter icing on each of the flat bases and sandwich these two buttercreamed surfaces together to make a rugby ball shape for the hedgehog body. Place onto a 30cm cake board or wooden board. Cut the loaf cake in half vertically. Take one half and trim the short end to a v shape to make the pointy head. Use a little icing to attach to the body. Cut pieces from the remaining loaf cake to fill any gaps. Cover the whole cake in butter icing.",
      "Cut the flake bars into pieces ranging from 2.5cm to 5cm. The spikes do not have to be regular or even in shape. Starting at the front push the spikes into the body of the hedgehog at a slight angle. Start with the small pieces gradually using larger ones as you go towards the back. Press a round chocolate into the tip of the head to represent the nose and use chocolate chips for the eyes. Using a tiny bit of butter icing attach sliver or gold balls to the eyes.",
      "The cake is best made the day before cutting and icing and will keep well for 3\u20134 days."

      "Bake the Easy vanilla cake in a greased, lined deep 20cm cake tin as in the basic recipe; drench with syrup and leave to cool. Leave the oven on.",
      "Break the white chocolate into cubes into a microwaveable bowl, and heat on High for 1 min (or melt over a pan of simmering water). Stir, then leave any remaining lumps to melt in the warm liquid chocolate. Once just-warm, beat the chocolate into the buttercream.",
      "Start the butterflies. Put the whole giant buttons on a flat baking tray on non-stick baking paper, then put into the oven for 20-30 secs or until the chocolate looks shiny. Take out, scatter with hundreds and thousands, then leave to set completely before cutting in half with a large non-serrated knife. For the ladybirds, pipe dots of icing all over the already cut giant button halves, then leave aside to dry.",
      "Spread the buttercream over the cake, then start to arrange the butterflies. Cut each Matchmaker into 3 \u2013 these will make the bodies. Press onto the cake, then stick four giant button halves around each body to make \u2018wings\u2019. For the ladybirds, place two spotty button halves together, then use a small button for the head. Scatter more hundreds and thousands all over the cake, then poke in the candles."

      "Spread the butter icing all over the cake. Cut the flake bars into small pieces and arrange on the wings to represent feathers. Keep the flake crumbs. Arrange milk chocolate buttons over the body. Place chocolate fingers on the bottom cake to make the fence. Using a fork, mark the icing to make the owl\u2019s ears. Use the flake crumbs to make a v-shape between the ears like a 'widow\u2019s peak'. Arrange the white chocolate buttons in two circles to make the eyes and place a milk chocolate button in the centre of each.

    ],
    "steps": [
      "Make the 15cm fruit cake. You can do this up to a month in advance and wrap it in cling film. Once a week you can feed it with a little dark rum or brandy by poking holes in the top and spooning a little into the holes.",
      "Marzipan the fruitcake. Heat the apricot jam until bubbling, then take off the heat. Sieve if necessary to remove any bits. Level off the top of the fruit cake using a long serrated bread knife. Brush the top with jam and flip the cake over and position it on top of the 15cm cake board. Briefly knead the marzipan and smooth into a ball. Dust the work surface with icing sugar. Roll out into a circle. Use a bit of string or tape measure to measure your fruit cake\u2019s top and sides so you know how far to roll out the dough. Brush the cake with apricot jam and then carefully transfer the marzipan to the cake (see picture 1). Gently smooth the top first, then ease your hands down the sides, carefully lifting and coaxing the marzipan so that it fits without overlapping (see picture 2). When you have reached the bottom edges of the cake, use a sharp knife to shave off any excess marzipan. You can do this up to a month in advance.",
      "Ice the cake drum (see picture 4). Lightly knead 500g icing and form into a ball. Dust your work surface with sifted icing sugar and roll out the icing in a circle using a tape measure to check that it is wide enough (23cm). Brush the drum with cooled boiled water and transfer the icing to the board. Gently roll over the board again, then trim the edges with a small sharp knife. Roll gently again if you like to get a really smooth finish. Watch out for fingerprints and bits of fluff as ready-to-roll icing can be quite delicate.You can do this in advance too. If you do, put it in a cake box to stop it gathering dust.",
      "Make the 23cm lemon cake. The unfilled cake will keep well if you wrap it with baking parchment and cling film for up to 4 days, or in the freezer for up to a month.",
      "Buttercream the zingy lemon cake. Make buttercream by beating together the butter, icing sugar and lemon zest. You can do this the day before icing.",
      "Level off the top of the lemon cake using a long serrated bread knife. Spread a little of the buttercream onto the 23cm cake board. Turn cake upside down onto the board. Brush all over with a thin layer of the sieved apricot jam - this helps to stop crumbs getting into the buttercream. Cut the cake in half horizontally using the bread knife. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s not perfect as people won\u2019t be able to see once the cake is covered. Use a palette knife to spread a layer of buttercream onto the top of the cut side of the cake on the board. Put the top layer back on and press down a little to level it. Spread the remaining buttercream on the top and sides of the cake using the palette knife to smooth the surface (see picture 3). Pop the cake in the fridge until the buttercream is firm, this will make it easier to ice.",
      "To cover the cakes in the icing, you\u2019ll need 500g for the smaller cake and 900g for the larger one. For each, gently work the icing into a ball. Dust the work surface with icing sugar and roll it into a circle. Again use a tape measure or piece of string to ensure the circle is big enough to cover the cake. In the case of the fruitcake, brush the marzipan with cooled boiled water, then transfer the icing onto the cake and smooth it down in the same way as the marzipan. Use a cake smoother if you have one to get a really smooth finish (see picture 5). For the lemon cake, you won\u2019t need any additional gluing, the buttercream will do the job. Once you have smoothed the icing over the cake, trim it carefully. A ribbon will hide the bottom of the cake so it doesn\u2019t need to be perfect. Save any leftover icing to make the decorations. Wrap it in clingfilm and put into a freezer bag to seal out the air.",
      "To stack the cakes, use three plastic dowels, these help to keep the cake stable and level. Insert three dowels in a triangle, 2cms in from where the edges of the smaller cake will be (see picture 6). With a pen, mark where the top of the icing comes to on the dowel. Carefully pull out the dowels, you can use tweezers for this, and line them up. Pick the dowel with the highest mark, this is the length you want all the dowels to be. Score the dowels with scissors at this length and cut or snap the plastic.",
      "Put the rods back into the three holes, rounded end down. Smooth a little leftover buttercream onto cake where the dowels are. Pick the best side of the smaller cake and aim to position this at the front. Carefully lift it onto the larger one, you can use a palette knife to help you lower the cake.",
      "To decorate, pinch off a small ball of icing and leave it white. Divide the remaining icing into quarters. Dye two quarters brown. Do this by dipping a toothpick into the colouring paste and gradually adding more colour to the icing, kneading it as you go (see picture 7). Keep going until you have the colour you want and it is smoothly incorporated with no streaks. It\u2019s better to do this gradually as the colours can be quite strong and it\u2019s easy to add too much.",
      "Dye the remaining two balls of icing in your chosen pastels. Wrap all of the balls in clingfilm and pop into a freezer bag until ready to use. This will stop them from becoming crusty.",
      "Start by decorating the bottom layer. Roll out the icing, cutting out approximately 12 shapes. We did six brown teddies and alternated them with either a pink duck (three in total) or a blue duck (three in total). Paint a small amount of edible glue onto the back of each teddy and stick it on. Then repeat with the ducks, placing them between the teddies. For the top layer, we cut out 12 small bunnies, alternating brown, blue, pink, brown, blue pink etc. Stick the shapes with even spacing between them on to the cake. The number of shapes you need will depend on the size of the cutters you\u2019ve chosen.",
      "To make the teddy, roll out one small ball for the head and one slightly larger one for the body. Stick the head on top of the body. Roll out two sausages of icing one for the legs and one for the arms. Cut them in half. Stick the arms to the side of the body and flatten the ends to form little paws. Next stick on the legs, again flattening the ends to form paws. Roll two small balls of brown, flatten and cup them slightly to make ears. Make a little ball of white icing to stick onto the face to make a muzzle. Dip a toothpick into the brown colouring paste and do two dots for eyes. Roll tiny balls of icing for the nose (in brown) and buttons (in white) and stick them on. If you like, take some white icing and make pads for the feet and for the inner ears too (see picture 9).",
      "To make the rabbit, roll a sausage of pink or blue icing and snip the top and the bottom one third along. Form the top into ears and the bottom into legs. Pinch a neck about 1 cm under the ears and then snip each side upwards from the legs to just below the neck to form arms and mould them slightly (see picture 8). Make a face by dipping your toothpick back into the brown paste and draw on eyes, a nose and whiskers. Sit the teddy on top of the cake and arrange the bunny on his lap.",
      "If you like and are handy with writing icing, write the child\u2019s name on the second tier or stick a candle there."

Pour the cake mixture evenly into the two tins, and bake for 25-30 mins until risen and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool in the tins for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack, peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool.",
      "Repeat steps 1 and 2, so that you have 4 sponge cakes in total. These sponges can be made up to three days ahead and will stay moist if wrapped in cling film, or you can wrap well and freeze for up to two months.",
      "To make the icing, put the butter in a large bowl and sieve in half the icing sugar. Roughly mash together with a spatula, then whizz with a hand mixer until smooth. Add the cream cheese and sieve in the remaining icing sugar, mash together again, then blend once more with the hand mixer. Put the biscuits in a food processor and whizz to fine crumbs. Add the biscuit crumbs to the icing and mix again until combined.",
      "Next, make the cookie cake toppers. You\u2019ll need one biscuit for each letter of the word you\u2019d like to write \u2013 someone\u2019s name or, like we have done, \u2018WOW!\u2019 Carefully insert a skewer into the creamy filling in the middle of each biscuit \u2013 some cookies may break, so save these ones for later. Melt the chocolate in the microwave, stirring every 20 secs or so, or in a heatproof bowl suspended over a pan of gently simmering water. Spread a little chocolate over the surface of one side of each cookie. Roll out the fondant icing to the thickness of a 50p coin, and cut out your letters, then stick these to the cookies and set aside to dry. Alternatively, let the chocolate dry, then use an icing pen to write the name or word directly on the surface.",
      "To assemble the cake, stick one of your sponges to a cake stand or board with a little of the cream cheese icing. Use roughly half the icing to stack the remaining cakes on top, spreading a generous amount between each layer. Pile the remaining icing on top of the assembled cake, and use a palette knife to ease it over the edges, covering the entire surface of the cake. Tidy the plate with a piece of kitchen paper.",
      "If you have any leftover biscuits, break them into pieces and push these around the base of the cake. Insert the dried cookie cake toppers into the top of the cake and serve. Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 2 days, but bring back to room temperature for an hour or so before eating."

Add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with the buttermilk. Divide the batter between the tins and level the tops.",

      "To make the buttercream, put the egg whites and sugar in a big bowl (the bowl of your tabletop mixer, if you have one) with the vanilla seeds and set over a pan of gently simmering water. Lightly whisk until the sugar has fully dissolved \u2013 you can test this by dipping two fingers into the bowl and rubbing them together; if you can\u2019t feel any grains of sugar, the mixture is ready. Remove the bowl from the heat and keep whisking until a thick meringue has formed. Continue whisking until the meringue has cooled to room temperature, then slowly add in the butter, 1 tbsp at a time. By the time all the butter has been incorporated, the mixture should have transformed into a silky-smooth buttercream. If it hasn\u2019t, continue to whisk until it does. If it still refuses to thicken, it may be the mixture is still too warm, so chill for 10 mins, then continue whisking. Add the vanilla extract and mix to combine.",
      "To assemble the cake, place a sponge on a cake board or serving plate and top with a thin layer of buttercream. Repeat with the remaining cake layers and finish by spreading the remaining buttercream over the top and sides of the cake (see below). To get a smooth finish, use the edge of a palette knife, and drag carefully around the sides of the cake, smoothing out the buttercream. To decorate the cake, press the sides of it with the edible polka dot sprinkles creating a full border at the bottom with less and less the further up the cake you go. Best served within 2 days of baking, but the cake will keep for up to 4 days."

      "250g pack unsalted butter",
      "50ml whole milk",
      "150g whole natural yogurt",
      "\u00bd tsp vanilla paste or extract",
      "3 large eggs",
      "250g white caster sugar",
      "300g self-raising flour",
      "2 tsp baking powder",
      "300g unsalted butter, very well softened",
      "450g icing sugar",
      "1 tsp vanilla paste or extract",
      "2 tsp whole milk",
      "2 heaped tbsp raspberry jam ( or lemon curd)",
      "1kg white sugarpaste",
      "green and pink food colouring paste (we used Sugarflair Spring Green and Fuchsia)",
      "a little icing sugar, sifted, for rolling out",
      "38g tube Smarties",
      "22inch/55cm square cake board",

    "steps": [
      "Heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Use a little of the butter to grease the sides and bases of two 20cm sandwich tins. Melt the rest of the butter in a small saucepan. Off the heat, add the milk, yogurt and vanilla, followed by the eggs. Beat well with a fork.",
      "Put the dry ingredients plus \u00bc tsp salt into a large bowl. Whisk to combine \u2013 this aerates and saves sifting. Tip in the wet ingredients and whisk to a smooth, silky batter.",
      "Don\u2019t hang around at this point. Pour the batter evenly into the prepared tins and put onto the middle shelf in the oven. Bake for 25 mins or until risen and a skewer inserted into the middle of the cakes comes out clean. Cool for 10 mins in the tins, then carefully invert the cakes and leave to cool upside down on a cooling rack.",
      "Make the buttercream. Put the butter into a large bowl and sift the icing sugar on top. Add the vanilla and milk and a pinch of salt then beat for a few mins with electric beaters until creamy, pale and spreadable.",
      "Sandwich the cakes with just under \u00bc of the buttercream and then all of the jam, if using. Mark the cake into six then cut out two of the wedges. Chill all of the cake in the fridge for 30 mins to firm up the crumbs, which will make icing easier.",
      "While you wait, colour the remaining buttercream with a little green food colouring gel.",
      "Split the sugarpaste into four pieces, one 500g, one 250g, one 150g and one 100g. Colour 250g green to make the legs and arms. Colour 150g pink, to make the spines.",
      "Position the cakes on the board and, once you\u2019re happy, use a little buttercream to anchor them. The main part of the cake will make the body of the dinosaur and the root of its tail, and the two cutout wedges will make the face.",
      "Shape the 500g piece of sugarpaste to make a tail, tapering at the end. Flatten the other end out (the piece will look a bit like a witch\u2019s hat at this point) and mould it over the tail part of the cake.",
      "Using a palette knife, spread the coloured buttercream over each piece of cake and the tail.",
      "Shape 100g white icing into eyes and teeth and poke them into the buttercream.",
      "Shape two small sausages to make an arm, with two claws, and position on the cake. Shape the rest of the green sugarpaste into two legs, adding claws if you like. Press them into the buttercream on the dinosaur\u2019s belly.",
      "Shape the pink icing into spikes and position them along the spine and under the tail. Use two small sausages of pink icing for the eyelids if you like. Finally press the Smarties all over the dinosaur, saving two for the eyes. Leave to set.",
      "If you want to cover the board, rub a few drops of blue colouring into the coconut until even. Mix the royal icing sugar with 2 tbsp water, then brush this all over the board and around the dinosaur. Sprinkle with the coconut and the chocolate sprinkles and leave to set. If the sponges are used fresh or within a day of baking (wrap well once cooled), the finished cake will keep in a cool place (not the fridge) for 3 days."

At first, it will look like it\u2019s not coming together, but keep working the dough through your fingers and it will become smooth and glossy. Form the dough into a ball and return it to the bowl.

Re-roll the trimmings (including the middles) and stamp out more (you should end up with six ring doughnuts). Re-roll any remaining trimmings and use the 4cm cutter to stamp out five or six mini bites. Put the doughnuts and bites on the prepared tray, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to prove in a warm place for another 2-3 hrs, or in the fridge overnight until doubled in size. The lightness of the doughnuts depends on thissecond proving, and a longer prove in the fridge will give the doughnuts more flavour.",

Heat to 170C or until a cube of bread dropped in browns in 30 seconds. Carefully lift two or three doughnuts from the tray and slide them into the hot oil using a floured spatula. Fry for 2 mins each side until puffed up and golden brown, then remove to a sheet of kitchen paper using a slotted spoon or tongs. Leave to cool. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts, then fry all the mini bites for a total of 2 mins.",
      "When the doughnuts and bites have cooled, you can either coat them in sugar or a glaze. For sugar doughnuts, combine the sugar and cinnamon, then toss with the doughnuts. For glazed doughnuts, sift the icing sugar into a bowl and mix in 2 tbsp cold water until you have a runny icing. Dip in the doughnuts, then decorate with the toppings of your choice. Best eaten straightaway, but will keep in an airtight container for a day."

If any wet cake mixture clings to the skewer, return the cake to the oven for 5 mins, then check again. Once cooked, remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for at least 20 mins.",

Cover with a lid and put in the oven for about 2 hrs until the meat is tender. Will keep chilled for three days or frozen for up to three months. Leave to cool completely first. Defrost in a fridge overnight before reheating thoroughly in a microwave or pan until the meat is piping hot.",

Cut the ox cheek into four large chunks, then season well and toss in the flour and mustard powder. Place the pieces of meat in the hot oil \u2013 they should sizzle \u2013 and brown the meat all over. Add the onion to the pan and continue cooking until softened and starting to caramelise. Add the thyme, stock cube, porcini and some seasoning. Pour 450ml water into the pan, stirring to scrape any meaty bits off the bottom. Cover with a lid and place in the oven to cook for 3 hrs, turning the meat over in the liquid once while cooking, and topping up with a splash of water if the pan looks dry.",

      "When their cooking time is up, scoop the ox cheeks out of the liquid and use 2 forks to shred the meat \u2013 discard any bits of fat or sinew. Strain the cooking liquid. Add 3-4 tbsp of the liquid back to the meat, along with the cooked mushrooms. Cool, then chill the meat mixture and the cooking liquid for 3 hrs, or up to 48 hrs.",

Arrange the prosciutto in pairs on top of the smaller circles of pastry, in a cross shape. Split the meat mixture in half and mount each portion on top of the prosciutto. Fold the prosciutto over the meat to encase it, then flip the little parcel of meat over, so the smooth side is facing up on top of the pastry. Brush the edge of each pastry circle with a little beaten egg, then place the larger circles of pastry on top. Use your hands to create a domed centre, then crimp the edges with a fork (or your fingers) to seal in the meat. Score the pastry in a criss-cross pattern, then brush all over with beaten egg.",

      "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and put a baking tray in the oven to heat up. Slide the wellingtons on their parchment onto the hot tray and bake for 30 mins. Meanwhile, reheat the cooking liquid, add the cream and peppercorns, and keep warm until ready to eat. Serve each wellington with green veg and the peppercorn gravy for pouring over."

      "50g butter",
      "800g onions (about 8), finely sliced",
      "300ml double cream",
      "small pinch of  grated nutmeg",
      "4 egg yolks (freeze the whites for another recipe, such as meringue)",

    "steps": [
      "First, make the pastry. Tip the flour and butter into a bowl, then rub together with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Mix in the egg, then bring everything together using your hands until just combined. Form into a disc. Will keep wrapped and chilled for up to two days or frozen for up to a month.",
      "Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface into a disc that\u2019s roughly 28cm in diameter. Use the rolling pin to lift it over a 23cm tart tin, then drape it over the tin. Use a small ball of pastry scraps to push the pastry into the base and up the side of the tin, leaving the excess to overhang. Chill in the fridge for 20 mins. The tin can be lined and chilled up to a day ahead.",
      "Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan over a low-medium heat and cook the onions for 45 mins, seasoning them generously with salt and stirring occasionally until they become sticky and golden. Pour in the cream, then add the nutmeg and stir. Bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat.",
      "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Lightly prick the base of the tart all over with a fork, then line with a large circle of baking parchment and fill with baking beans, dried rice or pulses. Bake for 20 mins, then remove the beans and parchment, and bake for 10-15 mins more until light brown. Break off a little of the the overhanging pastry to check that it\u2019s done \u2013 it should be cooked through and crumbly.",
      "Meanwhile, stir the egg yolks into the onion and cream mixture, and stir in two-thirds of the cheese. Tip into the pastry case, then sprinkle over the rest of the cheese and bake for 20-25 mins, or until just set and golden. Leave to cool completely in the tin, trim the overhang using a serrated knife, then remove from the tin. Sprinkle with chives and more cheese, if you like. Any leftovers will keep chilled for up to two days. Reheat in a low oven before serving."

      "100g milk chocolate, chopped into small pieces",

Using electric beaters, beat the butter and remaining sugar in a large bowl until light and creamy and the sugar has dissolved. Gradually beat in the egg yolks and cooled chocolate. Fold about \u2153 the whisked egg whites into the chocolate mixture. Sift the flour over the mixture in two batches and fold each in. Gently fold in the remaining beaten egg whites using a spatula.",

Heat the remaining cream in a separate pan and stir in the butter until melted. Remove from the heat and gradually add the chocolate, letting it melt into the cream, and stir in the sugar syrup. Place the cake on a cooling rack over a tray to catch any excess glaze. Evenly coat the cake with the glaze by pouring it slowly into the middle, tilting the cake gently so it flows slowly over the edges. Don\u2019t smooth it with a knife or it will look streaky.

      "Tip the flour into a large bowl along with the yeast. Pour over 325g room-temperature water (you\u2019ll get a more accurate amount by weighing the water, but you can also use 325ml, depending on your scales), then use your hands or a spatula to mix until a dough forms. It\u2019s important that you ensure all of the flour is mixed in, including any bits around the side of the bowl. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest for 30 mins.",
      "Sprinkle over the salt, then work it in by stretching the dough over the salt several times until fully incorporated. Tip out onto a lightly floured surface. Use the heel of one hand to stretch the dough while you hold it with your other hand. Then, fold the dough back onto itself, turn it 90 degrees to the left and repeat. Do this for about 5 mins, or until the dough looks shinier and immediately bounces back when rolled into a tight ball or gently poked. Roll the dough into a tight ball, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to prove at room temperature for 1 hr until doubled in size. Or, for a deeper flavour, transfer to a clean bowl, cover and leave to prove in the fridge overnight until doubled in size. Cold dough is easier to work with, so overnight is best.",
      "When the dough has doubled in size and is light and pillowy, tip it out onto a work surface and knead it a few more times to knock the air out. Gather the dough into a ball and leave to rest for 5 mins. Gently form the dough ball into a tight, rounded shape on the work surface, then tip domed-side down into a proving basket or bowl lined with a clean tea towel. Leave to prove in a warm place for 40 mins-1 hr, or in the fridge for 2-3 hrs until roughly doubled in size.",
      "Put a casserole along with its lid in the oven, then heat the oven to 230C/210C fan/gas 8. Once the oven is at temperature, remove the casserole. Flip the dough onto a square of baking parchment, slash it using a sharp knife and use the sides of the parchment to carefully lower the dough (still on the parchment) into the hot casserole. Cover with the lid. Bake for 25 mins. Remove the lid and bake for 5-10 mins more until it has a deeply golden, crisp crust and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Cool on a wire rack for 40 mins before slicing. Will keep in an airtight container for up to two days."

Mix 50g flour with 50g tepid water and stir into yesterday\u2019s mixture. Make sure all the flour is incorporated and leave, semi-uncovered, at room temperature for another 24 hrs.",
      "Day 5:The mixture should be very active now and ready for making your levain. If it\u2019s not bubbling, continue to feed it on a daily basis until it does. When it\u2019s ready, it should smell like yogurt.",

Keep it in the fridge (it will stay dormant) and 24 hrs before you want to use it, pour half of it off and feed it with 100g flour and 100g water. Leave it at room temperature and it should become active again. The longer the starter has been dormant, the more times it will need to be refreshed \u2013 the process of pouring off half the starter and replacing it with new flour and water \u2013 to reactivate. If your starter is ready to use, a teaspoonful of the mixture should float in warm water.",

Leave the levain for 8 hrs at room temperature until it becomes active. When ready, a teaspoonful of the mixture should float in warm water.",
      "For the breadPour 600g tepid water into the levain and stir with a rubber spatula to mix together \u2013 don\u2019t worry if there are unmixed bits of levain. Tip in the flour and mix everything together with a rubber spatula to make a rough dough, ensuring all the flour is incorporated evenly and that there are no dry bits up the side of the bowl. Cover and leave somewhere warm for at least 30 mins, or up to 4 hrs.",
      "Sprinkle over the salt and add 50g water to the dough. Pinch and scrunch the salt and water through the dough with your hands. If the dough goes stringy (like old chewing gum), just keep working it until it\u2019s one smooth texture. Leave for another 15 mins.",
      "Wet your hands, grab the dough from one side and stretch it over itself, then repeat with the other side. This stretching technique helps develop the gluten. Pick the dough up and curl it around onto itself, then cover and leave for another 20-30 mins. Repeat this process two more times (three in total), then leave the dough for another 2-3 hrs until it\u2019s risen by about 30% and looks bubbly and soft.",

Gradually add the flour in a stand mixer on its lowest setting. Once it\u2019s a wet dough, transfer to a well-oiled bowl, cover and leave for 12 hours or overnight at room temperature.",
      "In the morning, combine the yeast and milk and leave to stand for 10 mins. Tip into a freestanding mixer fitted with a dough hook, add 160ml water, the biga and the olive oil. Then add the flour and 1 heaped tsp salt. Use the dough hook of a stand mixer to combine the dough. Knead for 10 mins until smooth and elastic. Don\u2019t worry if it looks very wet, it should to be a very wet dough! Pour into a well-oiled bowl and cover with cling film. Leave to prove for an hour and a half or until doubled in size.",
      "Once rested, begin to do a series of folds \u2013 lift the dough from the edge, pull up, over, then release it. Turn the bowl 90 degrees and do the same again. Repeat so you do a full turn of the bowl twice, or 8 folds. Rest for 30 mins, then repeat the whole folding process once more.",
      "Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas mark 6. Tip the dough onto a really well-floured surface and cut in half. The dough will feel like a batter and spread across the surface a bit, but don\u2019t panic, just work on a well-floured surface, using the flour and a pastry scraper to help move the dough. Shape the dough into 2 large squares (about 20cm x 20cm). Dealing with each loaf at a time, fold the dough in from each side, as if folding a booklet. Flip over, then pick up the roll and place each onto separate well-floured sheets of baking paper. The roll will be very soft, so oil or flour your hands well. Allow to rest for another 30 mins, covered with a floured tea towel. Don\u2019t worry if it spreads a little.",
      "While the dough rests, heat a baking sheet in the oven. Once the dough has rested, slide each of the loaves, along with the baking paper beneath them, onto the hot baking sheet. Bake for 35-40 mins, until the crust is golden and the loaves sound hollow when tapped on the base. Move to a wire rack and cool for an hour before slicing and serving with olive oil and balsamic vinegar."

Add the icing sugar gradually, beating on slow to start with, then turning up the speed to max until the mixture is light and creamy. Pour in the cooled chocolate and combine thoroughly, add a splash of plant milk if the icing is very stiff. Chill the buttercream for at least 30 mins before using.",

Use the rolling pin to help you lift the marzipan circle over the cake and gently press it onto the surface (the apricot jam will help it stick). Divide the remaining marzipan into 11 pieces and roll into balls. Use a little more jam to stick the balls around the edge of the cake \u2013 these represent the 12 apostles, minus Judas. If you like, use a kitchen blowtorch to slightly burnish the marzipan balls and topping until just golden (do this carefully so they don't burn)."

In another bowl, mix together the sugar, egg and vanilla extract then pour it over the butter and flour mixture. Gently knead it together then separate the dough into 2 equal blocks. Knead some pink food colouring into one of them and keep the other plain. Wrap both types of dough in sheets of cling film and chill in the fridge for 20-30 mins.",

Lightly roll over the surface once or twice with your rolling pin just to press them together. Trim off all the edges so they're straight then carefully roll them up from one of the short edges to make a tight spiral. Wrap tightly in cling film and chill for 1hr or overnight.",
      "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line 2 trays with baking parchment. Unwrap the dough, trim the end and cut the rest into 20 slices and lay them cut side down on your prepared baking tray. Bake for 15-17 mins or until ever so slightly golden at the very edges. Allow them to cool on the tray before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "Mix the icing sugar with enough lemon juice to make it the consistency of smooth peanut butter and pour the sprinkles into a shallow bowl or plate. Dip the outside edges of the biscuits into the icing (or spread it onto the edges using the back of a teaspoon) and then into the sprinkles, turning to coat. Leave to set before serving."

Don\u2019t knead the mixture as this will make a heavy scone, and if the mixture seems a little too wet, leave for a few mins, as gluten-free flour requires more liquid than wheat flour. Stamp out rounds using a 7cm floured cutter, then place the scones on the baking tray, spaced apart. You will need to lightly squash the dough trimmings together to give you 8-9 scones in total. Brush the tops of the scones with milk, sprinkle with sugar and bake for 10-12 mins until pale golden. Serve with butter and jam, or push the boat out with clotted cream and strawberries, too. Best eaten on the day they are made."

      "Make the candied orange slices a day ahead if you can. Put the sugar and 300ml water in a medium saucepan and bring to the boil. Reduce to a gentle simmer, add the orange slices and cook for 1 hr-1 hr 10 mins or until the pith is translucent, turning occasionally. Line a baking tray with parchment. Carefully remove the slices from the syrup, place on the prepared tray and set aside to dry (at least 8 hrs) before cutting in half. Reserve the syrup.",
      "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Lightly grease a loaf tin (mine was 900g) with olive oil and line with a strip of baking parchment.",
      "Grind the hazelnuts in a food processor until they resemble coarse breadcrumbs (do not blitz them too much or they will become oily), then add to a bowl along with the orange zest, a pinch of salt and the flour, baking powder and cocoa. Mix together until evenly combined.",
      "Pour the oil and the orange juice into a jug and mix together. Put the eggs and sugar in a tabletop mixer or large bowl and whisk together for 5-10 mins or until the mixture has tripled in volume and holds a ribbon on the surface when the beaters are lifted out. Slowly pour the oil mixture into the egg mixture and fold together until combined.",
      "Add the flour mixture to the egg mixture in 3 or 4 additions, folding together until combined. You can\u2019t sieve this mixture over the eggs because of the hazelnuts, but try not to dump the flour in one place \u2013 you need to be careful and fold the batter to retain its lightness. Once fully combined, pour the batter into the prepared loaf tin and bake for 50-55 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.",
      "Prick the top of the cake all over, then pour over 5 tbsp of the reserved orange syrup. Cool in the tin for 15 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Trim the top of the cake (keep this for a mini trifle) and turn out, cut-side down, onto a serving platter.",
      "To decorate, pour the orange juice into a small pan and bring to a simmer. Put the chocolate in a small bowl, pour the orange juice over and stir together to form a smooth ganache. Set aside in the fridge until thickened, about 20-25 mins. Tip the hazelnuts into a small bowl and add the gold powder with a dash of water, stirring together to coat. Put the ganache in a piping bag fitted with a small round piping tip. Pipe in peaks over the top of the cake, decorating with the golden hazelnuts and the orange slices. Will keep for up to 3 days in an airtight container."
