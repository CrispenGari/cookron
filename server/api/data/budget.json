Put in a colander set over the sink and pour over a kettle of just-boiled water, then rinse the leaves under cold running water until cool enough to handle.

      "If the b\u00e9chamel sauce has thickened as it\u2019s cooled down, stir in a splash more milk. Spoon a third of the sauce over the base of a baking dish roughly 25 x 35cm. Lift a sheet of lasagne out of the bowl of cold water and lay on a board with one of the short ends facing you. Spoon a generous tbsp of the sausage ragu over one end, then roll it up to enclose the filling, making a short cannelloni \u2013 there will be a little overlapping pasta. Place it in the baking dish, then continue with the remaining ragu and lasagne sheets, arranging them in the baking dish in two rows of six cannelloni. Spoon any remaining ragu over the top, then pour over the b\u00e9chamel sauce to cover all the cannelloni rolls. Sprinkle with the remaining parmesan. Will keep covered and chilled for up to two days or frozen for up to two months. Leave to cool completely first. Defrost thoroughly in the fridge overnight before cooking. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6, then bake the cannelloni for 40 mins until bubbling at the edges and golden brown on top. Grind over some black pepper, if you like, and serve with a crisp green salad."

Drizzle a little rapeseed oil into a 30cm frying pan with an ovenproof handle and put it in the oven for 5 mins. Pour the batter into the pan, put it back in the oven and cook for 25 mins. Check the Yorkshire pudding. It should have a good dark brown colour at the edges and feel firm and dry. If it\u2019s ready, take it out and keep warm. To serve, spoon the sausage casserole into the Yorkshire, and scatter over the parsley, if you like."
