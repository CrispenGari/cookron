Simmer these in the stock for 30 mins, covered with a lid. Allow to cool in the stock. Ideally do this the day before and chill in the fridge. These can also be frozen if you wish.",
      "Mix the spice coating ingredients in one bowl. Place the gram flour in another and the plain flour in a third. Mix enough water into the gram flour until it has a texture similar to beaten egg. Dip the seitan pieces in the plain flour, shake off the excess, then coat each piece in the gram flour mixture and finally in the panko spice mix.",

Once it's hot, carefully drop in the seitan pieces and cook for 6 mins or so, until they are dark golden brown and crispy. Transfer to kitchen paper to drain off the excess oil and sprinkle with a little salt. Serve in toasted buns with salad or slaw, or alternatively as mock chicken dippers with BBQ sauce."

When cooked, pour off the boiling water and cool the eggs under cold water to stop them from cooking further. Mash the lentils well in a medium bowl with the back of a fork, then stir in the pork mince, sage, 2 tsp of the chives, the mustard, nutmeg, cooled shallots, a pinch of salt and a generous grating of black pepper. Peel the shells from the eggs and pat dry with kitchen paper.",
      "Divide the meat mix evenly into 4. Tip the flour onto a plate and roll in each egg to coat, tapping off any excess. Pat down a quarter of the meat mix on the work surface to a 12-13 cm circle, using the rest of the flour to keep it from sticking. Cup the circle in your hand and place one of the eggs in the centre. With both hands, pat, press and ease the meat mix around the egg until it is completely and evenly covered. Seal really well so there is no join, then pat and roll it into a good shape on the floured surface. Repeat with the rest of the meat mix and cooked eggs.",
      "Mix the panko crumbs on a large plate with the remaining chives. Beat the remaining egg on a plate, brush some all over each coated egg (you won\u2019t use it all), then roll the eggs in the panko crumbs, patting them on to stick. Lay the eggs on a baking parchment-lined baking tray and chill for 20-25 mins (but not overnight). Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5.",
      "Heat 2 tsp of the remaining oil in the pan you used for the shallot. When quite hot (it is hot enough when a few panko crumbs dropped in sizzle immediately and start to brown), put in 2 of the scotch eggs and roll in the oil to coat them well. Set the timer for 2 mins, then fry, turning often, to brown all over. You are just browning, not fully cooking the eggs at this stage, so don\u2019t overcook or the coating may start to split. Transfer to the lined baking tray and repeat with the remaining eggs, lowering the heat slightly if the pan gets too hot.",
      "Bake the scotch eggs for 12 mins. Remove and lay them on kitchen paper to drain and leave to cool slightly. Halve the scotch eggs using a sharp knife and serve slightly warm or cold. Best eaten the same day or, when cold, can be stored overnight in the fridge in an airtight container."

Rinse the preserved lemon under running water to remove some of the brine, then separate the middle from the peel (the middle part \u2013 the flesh and pips \u2013 is very sour) and discard the middle. Finely chop the soft peel until it resembles a paste. Tip into a bowl and add the remaining marinade ingredients and a pinch of salt. Whisk until combined, then pour roughly half the marinade over the chicken and rub it into all the nooks. For the best flavour, leave the chicken to marinate overnight, covered, in the fridge (store the remaining marinade in the fridge too), but if you\u2019re short on time, 2 hrs marinating will do.",

Toss the vegetables to coat and spread them out towards the edges of the tin. Place the chicken on top, skin-side up, and pour over any juices from the bag or dish. Season the chicken well and roast for 45 mins.",
