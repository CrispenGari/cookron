    "description": "This Pavlova cake is inspired by the fruity filling of the Austrian dessert, Spanische Windtorte, with strawberries, cream, cherries and almonds",
    "author": "Cassie Best",
    "rattings": 5,
    "ingredients": [
      "400g strawberries, hulled then halved or quartered (save a few whole with stalks on, to serve)",

      "100g flaked toasted almonds"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Heat oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 1 and cut 3 pieces of baking parchment to fit 3 baking sheets for the meringues (if you don\u2019t have 3 baking sheets, you can cook it in batches \u2013 simply divide the meringue mixture into 3 and cook separately). Using a plate or the base of a cake tin, draw a 20cm circle on each piece of parchment, then flip over so that the pencil side is facing down. Put 3 oven racks in your oven \u2013 if you only have 2 but have a large grill pan, this will work too, sat in the bottom of the oven.",
      "Put the egg whites in a large bowl, and whisk with an electric hand whisk until thick and holding soft peaks. Start adding the sugar, 1 or 2 tbsp at a time, whisking continuously. When all the sugar has been incorporated, the meringue should be thick, glossy and holding stiff peaks. Add the vinegar and whisk again briefly. Use a blob of meringue to stick down the corners of each piece of parchment to the trays. Divide the meringue between the 3 circles on the parchment, swirling it towards the outline to make thin circles. Scatter the almonds over, saving a few to serve on top once assembled. Bake for 1 hr, then leave to cool in the oven.",
      "When the oven is completely cold, remove the meringues and place somewhere cool and dry for up to 24 hrs, or assemble straight away. Toss the fruit with 1 tbsp icing sugar and set aside to macerate for 10-15 mins. Pour the cream, amaretto, almond extract and remaining icing sugar into a large bowl, and whisk until softly whipped. Use a little of the cream to stick your least successful meringue to a cake stand or plate. Spread over a third of the cream and scatter with some strawberries and cherries. Top with the remaining meringues, cream and fruit, finishing the top layer with the whole strawberries and cherries. Scatter over the remaining almonds and serve. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for 1 day."

      "Combine the raisins, sultanas, currants, cherries and brandy in a bowl. Add the clementine pulp and mix well. Cream the butter and sugar together until pale. Add the beaten eggs, a little at a time, mixing well between each addition. In another bowl, combine the spices, ground almonds, polenta and baking powder. Fold into the creamed mixture along with the dried fruit and clementine pulp.",

Put the clementine slices in the pan and stir through. To keep the clementines submerged in the syrup, cut out a circle of greaseproof paper to fit into the pan and place over the fruit. Cook over a low heat for 1 hr until glossy and translucent. Remove and spread out over greaseproof paper to cool.",
      "To serve, dust the whole cake with icing sugar, then arrange the clementine slices, overlapping, over the top of the cake."

      "200g dark chocolate (or gluten-free alternative), roughly chopped",
      "300g skinless (blanched) hazelnuts",
      "150g dark muscovado sugar",
      "150g golden caster sugar",

    "steps": [
      "First, make the cake. Heat oven to 170C/150C fan/gas 3. Grease and line a 23cm loose bottomed cake tin with baking parchment. Put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Allow the chocolate to slowly melt, then set aside to cool a little.",
      "Meanwhile, blitz the hazelnuts in a food processor until roughly chopped, then add the sugars and blitz again to a fine, sandy consistency. Tip into a mixing bowl and add the 1 whole egg and 5 egg yolks. This will be a very stiff batter, but with a bit of elbow grease, it will combine. When well incorporated, beat in the melted chocolate.",
      "Put the remaining egg whites in a clean bowl and whisk until they form medium peaks. Scoop a quarter of the egg whites onto the batter and beat it in to incorporate, then gently fold in the rest. Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 35-40 mins. A skewer inserted in the centre should come out reasonably clean, but the best indication that it is done is a smooth top with perhaps a few cracks, and a subtle springiness to the cake when gently prodded. Remove the cake from the oven and allow to cool completely in the tin.",
      "To make the ganache, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Put the cream and butter in a small saucepan and heat until the butter melts, but don\u2019t let it boil. Pour it over the chocolate and leave for 1-2 mins to melt, then stir to form a smooth, glossy ganache. When the cake has cooled, remove from the tin and place it on a cake stand or platter. When the ganache has cooled to a spreadable consistency, spread generously over the entire surface of the cake \u2013 as neatly or as messily as desired.",
      "To make the hazelnut spikes, place a large saucepan over a medium heat to get hot. Add the sugar and continue heating until dissolved. Increase heat and bubble, swirling the pan from time to time, until the caramel turns a gorgeous amber colour \u2013 but don\u2019t stir as this will cause the caramel to crystallise. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the caramel to cool and thicken to the consistency of golden syrup \u2013 if it sets too solid, simply place it over a low heat to melt again.",
      "Use a cocktail stick or wooden skewer to push into each hazelnut \u2013 make sure that you don\u2019t push it in where the seam is or the hazelnut will split. Place a sheet of baking parchment on the floor directly underneath your work surface \u2013 this will catch any drops of caramel. Dredge the hazelnut through the thickened caramel, coating it very generously indeed. Secure the cocktail stick to the work surface with some sticky tape or wedge under a heavy pan, so that the caramel covered hazelnut hangs over the edge. Allow the caramel to drip, like a stalactite, towards the floor and set hard. Repeat with all the hazelnuts and allow the caramel to set. When hardened, use scissors to gently trim the fine threads of caramel off the more robust, decorative spikes. Arrange the hazelnuts, spikes pointing up, in the centre of the cake."

      "Meanwhile, mix the soft cheese, lemon zest, thyme and oregano together. Add the garlic, then season to taste. Cover and chill until needed. Both the beetroot and filling can be prepared up to a day in advance and chilled until needed.",

      "Arrange a thin layer of overlapping beetroot slices in the bottom of the tin. Spoon over a thin layer of the filling, then repeat until everything has been used, finishing with a layer of beetroot slices. Cover, then weigh down the terrine with a piece of card and a couple of cans. Chill overnight.",
      "For the walnut brittle, line a baking tray with baking parchment and set aside. Toast the walnuts in a small, dry frying pan over a medium heat until they smell nutty. Tip out onto the tray and spread out in an even layer. Return the pan to the heat and sprinkle in the caster sugar. Cook until caramelised, swirling the pan occasionally but not stirring, until you have a deep amber caramel. Carefully pour this over the walnuts, then sprinkle with a large pinch of chilli flakes and sea salt. Leave to cool. Once cool, break the brittle into shards or pulse in a food processor for a finer texture. The walnut brittle can be made a week in advance and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.",
      "To serve, unwrap the beetroot terrine and turn out onto a board. Remove the baking parchment and top with the walnut brittle, then slice. Serve with toast and a balsamic-dressed salad, if you like."

Immediately put spoonfuls of meringue around the edge of the filling (if you start in the middle, the meringue may sink), then spread so it just touches the pastry (this will anchor it and help stop it sliding). Pile the rest into the centre, spreading so it touches the surface of the hot filling (and starts to cook), then give it all a swirl.",

      "Make the ice cream the day before. Whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks using electric beaters, then gradually beat in the sugar, whisking after each addition until you have a smooth, glossy meringue. Using the same beaters (no need to wash) whisk the cream with the pistachio paste to soft peaks. Fold the cream and egg yolks through the meringue, spoon into a container and freeze for six hours, or overnight.",
      "To make the souffl\u00e9s, brush the inside of six ramekins (about 300ml, if they\u2019re smaller, use more) with melted butter, then coat with caster sugar. The easiest way to do this is to tip some sugar into one dish and rotate the dish so a layer sticks to the butter, then tip the excess into the next dish and so on, adding more sugar if you need to.",
      "Whisk the egg yolks with 2 tbsp sugar, the flours and a pinch of salt. Heat the milk with the pistachio paste until just steaming then, whisking constantly, pour the liquid onto the egg yolk mixture. Clean out the milk pan, then pour the mixture back in, return to the heat and cook for 2-3 mins until it\u2019s the consistency of thick custard. Remove from the heat and cover the surface with cling film until needed. This can be done in the morning \u2013 keep this and the egg whites in a bowl, covered in the fridge.",
      "When ready to eat, heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and put a baking sheet on the top shelf to heat up. Using electric beaters, whisk the egg whites to medium-stiff peaks, then whisk in the remaining sugar. Mix a large spoonful of the egg whites into the pistachio mixture, then carefully fold in the rest. Divide between the ramekins, then run a cutlery knife around the top edge of each of the ramekin (this encourages the souffl\u00e9 to rise evenly). Transfer to the hot baking sheet and cook for 8-12 mins until well risen. Serve straight away (or they will collapse) topped with the pistachio ice cream."

Put the yeast, honey, vanilla seeds, flour and a pinch of salt in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment (use an electric hand whisk and large bowl if you don\u2019t have a stand mixer) and whisk for 30 secs to combine. On a medium speed, slowly add the eggs, then increase the speed and gradually beat in the butter, waiting for one bit to be fully incorporated before adding more. The texture of the finished dough will be very wet, similar to brioche. Cover the bowl with cling film and prove overnight in the fridge \u2013 this will make the dough easier to handle.",
      "The pears can also be poached the day before. Mix the sugar with the lemon juice and 500ml water in a medium saucepan and bring to the boil.

Remove the pears from the heat and leave to cool in the syrup, then refrigerate until needed.",
      "The next day, divide the dough into eight balls . Put each one into a buttered dariole mould, cover with buttered cling film and prove in a warm place for 1 -1 1/2 hrs until the dough has doubled in size. About 20 mins before the dough has finished proving, heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Bake the dough for 12 mins until golden and risen. Remove the puddings from the oven and cool for 5 mins, then remove from the moulds and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "To assemble the pudding, drain the poaching liquor into a saucepan, bring to the boil, then reduce the liquid by half. Put the sponges in a deep-sided dish, then pour over the hot syrup. Cover with cling film and leave for 30 mins, turning the puddings over halfway through. Pour the Poire Williams over the sponges, re-cover and leave for a further 30 mins . Serve one pudding per person with the poached pears, a dollop of Chantilly cream, a drizzle of the poaching syrup and some fresh lavender, if you like."

Leave to cool a little.",

    "steps": [
      "First, use a veg peeler to peel the butternut squash and heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Then using, a large, sharp knife cut a few 1cm thick ring-slices from the bulbous end, and a few small solid slices from the top end. Set aside the slices, and dice the rest into 1-2cm chunks. Toss the chunks with 1 tbsp of the sunflower oil on a baking parchment-lined tray and roast for 20-30 mins until tender and golden.",
      "Meanwhile prepare the tin. It\u2019s worth taking some time to do this, as it\u2019ll be the top of your cake in the end \u2013 and the bit you want to look impressive! Line the base of a deep, round, 25cm tin with a sheet of baking parchment. Brush the new base and sides with some oil, then start to arrange the rings in the base. You want to get in as many as you can, overlapping a bit like the Olympic rings. Snuggle in as many flat as you can, then sit your overlapping ones on top, cutting out bits of the squash, so they\u2019ll also sit flat too. Any leftover trimmings, put in a microwave-proof bowl with a splash of water, cover with cling film and microwave on High at 2 min intervals until tender \u2013 around 5-6 minutes.",
      "In a separate pan, soften the onion in the last 2 tbsp of sunflower oil, over a very low heat so it doesn\u2019t brown. Stir in the chopped sage, half the rosemary, and the garlic and mace, and cook for another few mins until fragrant. Mix the ground chia seeds or linseeds with 4 tbsp of water, and set aside with the cooling onions, until gluey.",
      "Meanwhile, roughly chop half the chestnuts but keep them chunky. Put the other half in a food processor with half the lentils, the microwaved squash and one-third of the roasted squash. Pulse to a mashed mixture. Tip this into a large mixing bowl with the softened onions, breadcrumbs, ground seed mixture and 1 tsp salt. Mash everything together really well to thoroughly mix, then more gently stir in the chopped chestnuts, followed by the whole lentils, and finally the remaining roasted squash chunks. Carefully press this mixture around and over the squash rings in the prepared tin. Level off the top, making sure it is tightly packed, then cover with foil. The cake can now be chilled for up to 24 hours before continuing.",
      "To bake, heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the cake (still foil covered), into the oven on a middle shelf and bake for 1 hr.",
      "To serve, heat the rapeseed oil in a small frying pan and sizzle the reserved sage leaves with the remaining rosemary sprigs for a minute. Loosen around the sides of the cake with a round-bladed knife, then sit a serving plate inverted on top, and carefully flip the plate to turn out the cake. Spoon over the sizzled sage and rosemary leaves and herby oil, and serve at the table \u2013 for cutting into wedges in front of everyone."

Press the pastry into the fluted edge, allow the excess to fall over the top edge, and run the rolling pin over the tops of the tins to trim the pastry.

When cooked, pour off the boiling water and cool the eggs under cold water to stop them from cooking further. Mash the lentils well in a medium bowl with the back of a fork, then stir in the pork mince, sage, 2 tsp of the chives, the mustard, nutmeg, cooled shallots, a pinch of salt and a generous grating of black pepper. Peel the shells from the eggs and pat dry with kitchen paper.",
      "Divide the meat mix evenly into 4. Tip the flour onto a plate and roll in each egg to coat, tapping off any excess. Pat down a quarter of the meat mix on the work surface to a 12-13 cm circle, using the rest of the flour to keep it from sticking. Cup the circle in your hand and place one of the eggs in the centre. With both hands, pat, press and ease the meat mix around the egg until it is completely and evenly covered. Seal really well so there is no join, then pat and roll it into a good shape on the floured surface. Repeat with the rest of the meat mix and cooked eggs.",
      "Mix the panko crumbs on a large plate with the remaining chives. Beat the remaining egg on a plate, brush some all over each coated egg (you won\u2019t use it all), then roll the eggs in the panko crumbs, patting them on to stick. Lay the eggs on a baking parchment-lined baking tray and chill for 20-25 mins (but not overnight). Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5.",
      "Heat 2 tsp of the remaining oil in the pan you used for the shallot. When quite hot (it is hot enough when a few panko crumbs dropped in sizzle immediately and start to brown), put in 2 of the scotch eggs and roll in the oil to coat them well. Set the timer for 2 mins, then fry, turning often, to brown all over. You are just browning, not fully cooking the eggs at this stage, so don\u2019t overcook or the coating may start to split. Transfer to the lined baking tray and repeat with the remaining eggs, lowering the heat slightly if the pan gets too hot.",
      "Bake the scotch eggs for 12 mins. Remove and lay them on kitchen paper to drain and leave to cool slightly. Halve the scotch eggs using a sharp knife and serve slightly warm or cold. Best eaten the same day or, when cold, can be stored overnight in the fridge in an airtight container."

Cover, bring to the boil, then lower to a gentle simmer for about 1 \u00be hrs or until the chicken is cooked (the legs will fall easily away from the body). Remove from the heat, but leave the chicken in the liquid to cool for about 3 hrs. When cold, lift the chicken out of the stock then strain (skim off any fat from the stock) and keep 200ml for the sauce. Can be done a day ahead and chilled. The excess stock can be chilled the frozen.",

Pour in the reserved chicken stock, then stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e. Cover and simmer for 10 mins. At the same time, put the apricots in a small pan with enough water to just cover them, then simmer for 15 mins. Drain, reserving 1 tbsp of the liquid. Pur\u00e9e the apricots in a small blender with the reserved liquid then press through a sieve (you should get about 1 tbsp pur\u00e9e). Remove curry sauce from the heat then stir in the sugar. Strain through a sieve, pressing as much through as you can with a wooden spoon, then stir in the lime juice and apricot pur\u00e9e and leave until cold.",
      "Mix together the mayonnaise and fromage frais, then stir in the cold curry sauce. Season to taste with a good grinding of pepper.",
      "Cut the spring onions into long, slim slivers, then set aside. If you want them to curl, put into a bowl of iced water while you finish the salad. Remove the skin from the chicken. Strip the meat off the bones in chunky pieces, remove the breasts separately and thickly slice. Gently toss the chicken with the curried sauce, the coriander and most of the mango. Scatter the watercress onto a platter. Spoon the chicken mix on top, tuck in the rest of the mango and finish with a pile of (drained) spring onions."

Bake for 20 mins more, or until the pie is deep golden and the almonds are toasted. While the pie bakes, combine the dressing ingredients.",
