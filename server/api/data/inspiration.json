    "description": "This Pavlova cake is inspired by the fruity filling of the Austrian dessert, Spanische Windtorte, with strawberries, cream, cherries and almonds",
    "author": "Cassie Best",
    "rattings": 5,
    "ingredients": [
      "400g strawberries, hulled then halved or quartered (save a few whole with stalks on, to serve)",
      "400g cherries, halved and pitted (save a few whole with stalks on, to serve)",
      "50g icing sugar, plus 1 tbsp",
      "600ml pot double cream",
      "50ml amaretto",
      "\u00bd tsp almond extract",

      "100g flaked toasted almonds"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Heat oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 1 and cut 3 pieces of baking parchment to fit 3 baking sheets for the meringues (if you don\u2019t have 3 baking sheets, you can cook it in batches \u2013 simply divide the meringue mixture into 3 and cook separately). Using a plate or the base of a cake tin, draw a 20cm circle on each piece of parchment, then flip over so that the pencil side is facing down. Put 3 oven racks in your oven \u2013 if you only have 2 but have a large grill pan, this will work too, sat in the bottom of the oven.",
      "Put the egg whites in a large bowl, and whisk with an electric hand whisk until thick and holding soft peaks. Start adding the sugar, 1 or 2 tbsp at a time, whisking continuously. When all the sugar has been incorporated, the meringue should be thick, glossy and holding stiff peaks. Add the vinegar and whisk again briefly. Use a blob of meringue to stick down the corners of each piece of parchment to the trays. Divide the meringue between the 3 circles on the parchment, swirling it towards the outline to make thin circles. Scatter the almonds over, saving a few to serve on top once assembled. Bake for 1 hr, then leave to cool in the oven.",
      "When the oven is completely cold, remove the meringues and place somewhere cool and dry for up to 24 hrs, or assemble straight away. Toss the fruit with 1 tbsp icing sugar and set aside to macerate for 10-15 mins. Pour the cream, amaretto, almond extract and remaining icing sugar into a large bowl, and whisk until softly whipped. Use a little of the cream to stick your least successful meringue to a cake stand or plate. Spread over a third of the cream and scatter with some strawberries and cherries. Top with the remaining meringues, cream and fruit, finishing the top layer with the whole strawberries and cherries. Scatter over the remaining almonds and serve. Leftovers will keep in the fridge for 1 day."

    "author": "John Whaite",

    "ingredients": [
      "200g dark chocolate (or gluten-free alternative), roughly chopped",
      "300g skinless (blanched) hazelnuts",
      "150g dark muscovado sugar",
      "150g golden caster sugar",

    "steps": [
      "First, make the cake. Heat oven to 170C/150C fan/gas 3. Grease and line a 23cm loose bottomed cake tin with baking parchment. Put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Allow the chocolate to slowly melt, then set aside to cool a little.",
      "Meanwhile, blitz the hazelnuts in a food processor until roughly chopped, then add the sugars and blitz again to a fine, sandy consistency. Tip into a mixing bowl and add the 1 whole egg and 5 egg yolks. This will be a very stiff batter, but with a bit of elbow grease, it will combine. When well incorporated, beat in the melted chocolate.",
      "Put the remaining egg whites in a clean bowl and whisk until they form medium peaks. Scoop a quarter of the egg whites onto the batter and beat it in to incorporate, then gently fold in the rest. Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake for 35-40 mins. A skewer inserted in the centre should come out reasonably clean, but the best indication that it is done is a smooth top with perhaps a few cracks, and a subtle springiness to the cake when gently prodded. Remove the cake from the oven and allow to cool completely in the tin.",
      "To make the ganache, put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Put the cream and butter in a small saucepan and heat until the butter melts, but don\u2019t let it boil. Pour it over the chocolate and leave for 1-2 mins to melt, then stir to form a smooth, glossy ganache. When the cake has cooled, remove from the tin and place it on a cake stand or platter. When the ganache has cooled to a spreadable consistency, spread generously over the entire surface of the cake \u2013 as neatly or as messily as desired.",
      "To make the hazelnut spikes, place a large saucepan over a medium heat to get hot. Add the sugar and continue heating until dissolved. Increase heat and bubble, swirling the pan from time to time, until the caramel turns a gorgeous amber colour \u2013 but don\u2019t stir as this will cause the caramel to crystallise. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the caramel to cool and thicken to the consistency of golden syrup \u2013 if it sets too solid, simply place it over a low heat to melt again.",
      "Use a cocktail stick or wooden skewer to push into each hazelnut \u2013 make sure that you don\u2019t push it in where the seam is or the hazelnut will split. Place a sheet of baking parchment on the floor directly underneath your work surface \u2013 this will catch any drops of caramel. Dredge the hazelnut through the thickened caramel, coating it very generously indeed. Secure the cocktail stick to the work surface with some sticky tape or wedge under a heavy pan, so that the caramel covered hazelnut hangs over the edge. Allow the caramel to drip, like a stalactite, towards the floor and set hard. Repeat with all the hazelnuts and allow the caramel to set. When hardened, use scissors to gently trim the fine threads of caramel off the more robust, decorative spikes. Arrange the hazelnuts, spikes pointing up, in the centre of the cake."

Slowly pour the water over the flour while mixing with a spoon to form a stiff dough. When the dough is cool enough to handle, tip onto a surface and knead for 10 mins until smooth. Wrap the dough and chill for at least 1 hr. Alternatively, you can use 25-30 shop-bought gyoza skins.",
      "Meanwhile, coarsely grate the cabbage, mushrooms, carrot and water chestnuts, if using, then tip into a bowl. Add the ginger, garlic and spring onions. Heat the oil in a wok, then tip in all the veg and stir-fry over a high heat for 3 mins until softened. Drizzle over the soy sauce and sake, and cook for 2-3 mins. Season to taste. Tip back into the bowl to cool completely.",
      "Divide the dough in two. Scatter a surface generously with cornflour and roll one ball of dough out until paper-thin. Use a 10cm cutter to cut out rounds of dough and pile them up (they won\u2019t stick because of the cornflour). Repeat with all the dough, re-rolling the trimmings until you have about 25 skins.",
      "To assemble, sprinkle cornflour on a tray and have a bowl of cold water ready. Hold a skin in the palm of one hand and put a teaspoon of the filling in the centre. Dip your finger in the water and wipe around the inside edge of the skin. Bring the edges of the skin together, pinching pleats along one side. Space them out on a baking tray and freeze, then tip into a bag and put back in the freezer. Will keep for three months. Can be cooked from frozen. ",
      "Heat a drizzle of oil in a non-stick frying pan with a lid. Fry, flat-side down, for 2 mins until golden. Add 100ml water to the pan and cover. Cook over a medium heat for 3-5 mins until the water has evaporated and the gyoza is cooked through. Remove the lid and leave the gyoza to sizzle on the bottom for a minute. Mix the dipping sauce ingredients together, then serve with the gyoza."

Blitz the bread and garlic with the nuts, lemon zest and coriander in a food processor using the pulse button (you want a coarse mix). Mix in the vinegar, sherry and salt, and add lemon juice to taste.",

Pat the scallops dry with kitchen paper (they don\u2019t colour well if you fry them when they\u2019re wet) and brush with extra virgin olive oil.",
      "Fry the chorizo in a little oil in a small frying pan until well coloured all over with a slight crust.",
      "Meanwhile, heat another pan until searing hot, add a small glug of oil, then the scallops. Season and cook for about 30 secs each side \u2013 you want just a little colour. Divide the scallops between the four shells, add the chorizo and top with the hazelnut mixture and a knob of butter. Put under a hot grill until cooked through (mine took about 90 secs). Squeeze on a little more lemon juice and serve immediately."

      "6 tsp chilli flakes (use less if you prefer less heat)",
      "400g broad beans (podded weight, about 1.4kg unpodded)",
      "2 garlic cloves, chopped",
      "8 mint sprigs, leaves picked and torn, plus extra to serve",
      "8 anchovy fillets, chopped",

      "2 tbsp pecorino, grated",
      "\u00bd lemon, juiced or to taste"

    "steps": [
      "Put the chops in a large bowl with the olive oil, lemon juice, chilli and some black pepper. Turn them with your hands, cover and put in the fridge to marinate for a few hours.",
      "Shell the broad beans and cook them in boiling water for 2-3 mins until tender. Drain and rinse in cold water. Slip each bean out of its skin, put them in the bowl of a food processor and add the garlic, mint and anchovy fillets. Remove any fronds from the fennel and set them aside with the tips. Take off any coarse outer layer, split the fennel in half and remove the hard core from each piece. Discard these. Chop the flesh and the reserved fennel trimmings. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a small frying pan and fry the fennel flesh gently for 10 mins until soft.",
      "Tip the fennel into the food processor along with the cheese and a little seasoning. Blitz to a pur\u00e9e while pouring in 120ml of the olive oil. Taste and add the lemon juice. You might find you want a bit more olive oil as well, or a little water to produce a thinner consistency. Remember to season again if you add water. Scrape the pur\u00e9e into a bowl and keep covered in the fridge until you\u2019re ready to serve, but let it come to room temperature before you cook the chops.",
      "Take the chops out of the fridge and bring to room temperature. Heat a griddle pan over a high heat. Lift the chops out of the marinade and, when the pan is really hot, cook until well coloured on each side, seasoning as you go. Press the meaty bit down so that they get good griddle marks. The chops should be pink in the middle when you serve them \u2013 they only take 1\u00bd mins on each side as they\u2019re so small. Do this in batches if you need to.",
      "Serve the chops on top of the pur\u00e9e with some mint scattered over, any reserved fennel fonds, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and some lemon wedges on the side."

    "rattings": 4,
    "ingredients": [
      "200g butter, melted",
      "3 tbsp cocoa powder, for dusting",
      "50g caramel sauce",
      "200g dark chocolate, chopped",
      "4 tbsp very strong coffee powder (espresso is ideal)",
      "6 eggs, three whole, plus the yolks of 3 (freeze the leftover egg whites for another recipe)",

      "50g plain flour",
      "6 small metal pudding basins"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Use 50g of the butter to brush the insides of the pudding basins. Put them on a baking tray and transfer to the fridge to chill until the butter sets. Brush over another layer of the butter, then dust generously with the cocoa. Return to the fridge to set. Mix the caramel sauce with a good pinch of sea salt flakes, then chill in the fridge until ready to use. ",
      "Tip the remaining butter, the chocolate and coffee powder into a heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over a pan of gently simmering water, ensuring the bottom of the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the water. Stir the mixture until smooth, adding another small pinch of sea salt. Tip the whole eggs, egg yolks and sugar into another bowl and beat together using an electric whisk until very pale \u2013 the whisk should leave a trail in the mixture when lifted. Sift in the flour, then gently fold in the melted chocolate mixture.",
      "Spoon the fondant mixture into the prepared basins until just about halfway full, then transfer to the freezer on a baking tray for about 20-25 mins, or until the mixture is just set. Add 1 tsp of the salted caramel sauce to the middle of each fondant, then top up with the remaining fondant mixture. Return to the freezer until frozen. Can be prepared up to two weeks ahead.",
      "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the fondants on a baking tray and bake for 15 mins until the tops have formed a crust and they are starting to come away from the sides of the basins. Remove from the oven, then leave to rest for 1 min before turning out onto warm plates. Sprinkle with extra sea salt, then serve straightaway."

    "steps": [
      "For the pastry, put the plain flour, butter, icing sugar, egg yolk (save the white for the meringue) and 1 tbsp cold water into a food processor. Pulse until the mix starts to bind \u2013 make sure the mix is not overworked.",
      "Tip the pastry onto a lightly floured surface, gather together until smooth, then roll out and line a 23 x 2.5cm loose-bottom fluted flan tin. Trim and neaten the edges. Press pastry into the flutes. The pastry is quite rich, so don\u2019t worry if it cracks, just press it back together. Prick the base with a fork, line with foil, shiny side down, and chill for 30 mins-1 hr (or overnight).",
      "Put a baking sheet in the oven and heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Bake the pastry case \u2018blind\u2019 (filled with dry beans) for 15 mins, then remove the foil and bake a further 5-8 mins until the pastry is pale golden and cooked. Set aside. Can be done a day ahead. Lower the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.",
      "While the pastry bakes, prepare the filling. Mix the cornflour, golden caster sugar and lemon zest in a medium saucepan. Strain and stir in the lemon juice gradually. Make the orange juice up to 200ml with water and strain into the pan. Cook over a medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened and smooth.",
      "Once the mixture bubbles, remove from the heat and beat in the butter until melted. Beat the egg yolks (save white for meringue) and the whole egg together, stir into the pan and return to a medium heat. Keep stirring vigorously for a few minutes, until the mixture thickens and plops from the spoon. (It will bubble, but doesn\u2019t curdle.) Take off the heat and set aside while you make the meringue.",
      "Put the egg whites in a large bowl. Whisk to soft peaks, then add 100g of the golden caster sugar a spoonful at a time, whisking between each addition without overbeating. Whisk in the cornflour, then add the remaining 100g of sugar as before until smooth and thick.",
      "Quickly reheat the filling and pour it into the pastry case. Immediately put spoonfuls of meringue around the edge of the filling (if you start in the middle, the meringue may sink), then spread so it just touches the pastry (this will anchor it and help stop it sliding). Pile the rest into the centre, spreading so it touches the surface of the hot filling (and starts to cook), then give it all a swirl.",
      "Return to the oven for 18-20 mins until the meringue is crisp and slightly coloured. Let the pie sit in the tin for 30 mins, then remove and leave for at least another 30 mins-1 hr before slicing. Eat the same day."

Sprinkle nutmeg over the top generously and bake for 50-55 mins until the custard is set with a little wobble when gently shaken. Leave to cool. Chill for at least two hours, or up to two days.",
      "When ready to cook the pineapple, heat oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Peel it using a knife to carve away the skin, then cut into four wedges and remove the core. Slice lengthways into long slivers. Arrange over a baking tray lined with parchment. Mix the sugar, rum (or lime juice) and a grating of nutmeg, then paint this over the pineapple.

Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together with a spatula, moving the bowl round after each folding so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour is a dark brown. Try not to knock the air out.",

Gently fold in this powder as well as the espresso mixture using the same figure-of- eight action as before. The mixture will look dry and dusty at first; keep going until it looks fudgy, but don\u2019t overdo this mixing. Pour the mixture into the tin and gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the spatula from side to side across the top to level it. Push the chocolate balls into the brownie at regular intervals.",

Bring to a simmer and stir over a medium heat until thickened. Add the vodka and turn off the heat. Serve each square of brownie with the sauce poured over."

It\u2019s a good idea to turn the pears over a couple of times while they\u2019re cooking so that they are cut-side down in the liquor for part of the cooking time.",
      "By the time the fruit is cooked, the juice around it won\u2019t be thick, but should be syrupy and sweet enough to serve as it is. If you don\u2019t think it is, then remove the pears and bay leaves and reduce the juices by boiling them for a little while, leave to cool, then pour them back into the dish with the pears. Leave at room temperature and add the berries about 30 mins before you want to serve, spooning the juices over them, otherwise they get very soft sitting in the red wine syrup."

Pulse again until it comes together into a ball, then transfer to a lightly dusted work surface and knead briefly until smooth. Wrap and chill for 30 mins.",
      "To make the filling, heat the oil in a frying pan over a low-medium heat, and cook the onion for 30 mins until sticky, golden and caramelised. This will take some time, but it will add depth and sweetness to the pie. Add a splash of water if the onions start to darken too quickly or catch.",

    "steps": [
      "First, use a veg peeler to peel the butternut squash and heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Then using, a large, sharp knife cut a few 1cm thick ring-slices from the bulbous end, and a few small solid slices from the top end. Set aside the slices, and dice the rest into 1-2cm chunks. Toss the chunks with 1 tbsp of the sunflower oil on a baking parchment-lined tray and roast for 20-30 mins until tender and golden.",
      "Meanwhile prepare the tin. It\u2019s worth taking some time to do this, as it\u2019ll be the top of your cake in the end \u2013 and the bit you want to look impressive! Line the base of a deep, round, 25cm tin with a sheet of baking parchment. Brush the new base and sides with some oil, then start to arrange the rings in the base. You want to get in as many as you can, overlapping a bit like the Olympic rings. Snuggle in as many flat as you can, then sit your overlapping ones on top, cutting out bits of the squash, so they\u2019ll also sit flat too. Any leftover trimmings, put in a microwave-proof bowl with a splash of water, cover with cling film and microwave on High at 2 min intervals until tender \u2013 around 5-6 minutes.",
      "In a separate pan, soften the onion in the last 2 tbsp of sunflower oil, over a very low heat so it doesn\u2019t brown. Stir in the chopped sage, half the rosemary, and the garlic and mace, and cook for another few mins until fragrant. Mix the ground chia seeds or linseeds with 4 tbsp of water, and set aside with the cooling onions, until gluey.",
      "Meanwhile, roughly chop half the chestnuts but keep them chunky. Put the other half in a food processor with half the lentils, the microwaved squash and one-third of the roasted squash. Pulse to a mashed mixture. Tip this into a large mixing bowl with the softened onions, breadcrumbs, ground seed mixture and 1 tsp salt. Mash everything together really well to thoroughly mix, then more gently stir in the chopped chestnuts, followed by the whole lentils, and finally the remaining roasted squash chunks. Carefully press this mixture around and over the squash rings in the prepared tin. Level off the top, making sure it is tightly packed, then cover with foil. The cake can now be chilled for up to 24 hours before continuing.",
      "To bake, heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the cake (still foil covered), into the oven on a middle shelf and bake for 1 hr.",
      "To serve, heat the rapeseed oil in a small frying pan and sizzle the reserved sage leaves with the remaining rosemary sprigs for a minute. Loosen around the sides of the cake with a round-bladed knife, then sit a serving plate inverted on top, and carefully flip the plate to turn out the cake. Spoon over the sizzled sage and rosemary leaves and herby oil, and serve at the table \u2013 for cutting into wedges in front of everyone."

Bake for 20-25 mins until golden and puffed up. Allow to cool, then chill in the fridge until ready to serve. Can be made up to a day ahead."

      "400g pack cherry tomatoes on the vine",
      "olive oil, for drizzling",

    ],
    "steps": [
      "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the tomatoes in a roasting tin, drizzle with a little olive oil and season. Roast for 25-30 mins until they start to shrink and darken, then remove and leave to cool.",
      "Dry-fry the pancetta until crisp and golden. Set aside on a plate lined with kitchen paper and leave to cool.",
      "Meanwhile, make the pastry. In a food processor, pulse the flour and 1/2 tsp salt a few times. Add the butter and whizz for about 20 secs until you have a fine crumb. While the processor is going, add 2-3 tbsp of ice-cold water and 1 egg yolk. Mix until a dough is just formed, but do not over-process. Remove the dough, press it into a lump, wrap in cling film and chill for at least 30 mins.",
      "Once rested, lightly dust the work surface with a little flour and roll out the dough to a very thin layer, about the thickness of a lasagne sheet. Line each tartlet tin with pastry by cutting a circle around a plate or bowl that\u2019s slightly larger than the tins. Press the pastry into the fluted edge, allow the excess to fall over the top edge, and run the rolling pin over the tops of the tins to trim the pastry. Re-roll the pastry off-cuts until you\u2019ve lined all your tins, then put in the fridge again for 30 mins or until firm.",
      "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line the tart cases with baking parchment and baking beans, then bake for 10 mins. Remove the paper and beans, and bake for a further 5 mins until just turning lightly golden. As soon as the cases come out of the oven, brush them all over with egg white. This creates a seal to protect the pastry from becoming wet from the filling, and ensures a crisper pastry case.",
      "Scatter half the grated cheese and crumble the crispy pancetta into each tart case. Nestle in the roasted tomatoes, then top with the remaining cheese.",
      "In a jug, beat together the remaining eggs, the cream and some black pepper. Add the basil and beat again to combine. Put a baking tray in the oven to heat up, then put the quiches on the hot tray resting on the oven shelf and carefully pour the egg mix over the filling until the cases are full. Bake for 20-25 mins until golden and puffed up. Allow to cool, then chill in the fridge until ready to serve. Can be made up to a day ahead."

When quite hot (it is hot enough when a few panko crumbs dropped in sizzle immediately and start to brown), put in 2 of the scotch eggs and roll in the oil to coat them well. Set the timer for 2 mins, then fry, turning often, to brown all over. You are just browning, not fully cooking the eggs at this stage, so don\u2019t overcook or the coating may start to split. Transfer to the lined baking tray and repeat with the remaining eggs, lowering the heat slightly if the pan gets too hot.",

Remove from the heat, but leave the chicken in the liquid to cool for about 3 hrs.

    "ingredients": [
      "12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs",
      "500g Greek yogurt",
      "2 lemons, juiced, \u00bd lemon zested",
      "100ml olive oil",
      "4 garlic cloves, very finely grated or crushed",
      "1 tbsp  ground coriander",
      "1 tbsp  ground cumin",
      "1 tbsp  sweet paprika",
      "1 tsp dried oregano",
      "1 tsp dried thyme",
      "1 tsp cayenne pepper",
      "1 tsp crushed black pepper",
      "\u00bd tsp  ground cinnamon",
      "2 red onions, halved and finely sliced",
      "4 tomatoes (plum work well) halved and sliced"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "First, whisk all the marinade ingredients together with 1 tsp salt in a large bowl or, better still, a large plastic container that has a lid. Open out each chicken thigh, cover with a piece of baking parchment and flatten it with your hand, then lift off the paper and cut the thigh in half. Tip into the marinade and mix so it\u2019s completely coated. Cover, chill and marinate for at least 1 hr or up to 24 hrs \u2013 the longer, the better.",
      "Thread all the chicken onto two skewers so that both skewers go through each piece of meat, packing down tightly as you go to make a compact kebab (see tip, below).",
      "Light a lidded barbecue, and let the flames die down. Once the coals have turned ashen, pile them up on one side with a single layer of coals scattered around the other side. Lay the chicken kebab on the side of the barbecue with only a few coals underneath. Put the lid down and cook for 45 mins, turning every 15 mins. To finish, lift the lid and roll the kebab over to the hotter side to char the meat, turning it every few minutes until well browned and cooked through. Prise the chicken pieces apart in the centre to check they\u2019re cooked, or use a digital cooking thermometer \u2013 it should read 70C or more. Leave to rest for 5-10 mins while you cook the pittas (see recipe, opposite). Bring the kebab to the table and carve into thin slices with a serrated knife. Pile the carved meat into the warm pittas, then the sliced red onions and tomatoes, chips and tzatziki (see our recipes, below)."

Add the lamb along with the bone, and cook for 10 mins more until the lamb has started to colour. Pour in the wine, then add the lettuce. Cook for 5 mins more. Tip in 3 litres cold water, cover and cook for about 1 hr until the lamb is tender.",

When the lamb has had 40 mins, add half the herb and spinach mix to the pan and continue cooking for the remaining 20 mins. Remove the bone and discard, then remove the meat using a slotted spoon, transfer to a board and shred using two forks. Return the meat to the pan, remove from the heat and add the rest of the spinach mix.",
      "To make the dolma filling, spoon a third of the lamb and spinach from the soup into a bowl using a slotted spoon, then mix with the uncooked rice, 3 tbsp of the oil, the lemon juice and some seasoning. Spread the vine leaves out on a board and put a teaspoon of the filling in the centre of each. Roll each one up into a cigar shape, tucking in the ends as you go to enclose the filling. Arrange the dolma in a single layer in a small saucepan and drizzle with the rest of the oil and a ladleful of the soup. Cover and cook for 20 mins over a medium heat. Remove from the heat and set aside.",

Put about three dolma in each bowl, ladle over the soup, sprinkle with some chilli flakes, if you like, and serve with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over."

Put one sponge on a cake stand or serving plate, and pipe just under half the icing around the edge using a circular motion for a wavy effect. Pipe a little more icing over the empty middle (this doesn\u2019t need to be neat) and smooth with the back of a spoon. Chill for 45 mins-1 hr until set. Top with the second sponge, then pipe eight blobs of icing around the edge at regular intervals, leaving a gap between each. Spoon the candied lemon zest into each gap, then serve."

    "ingredients": [
      "500g block shortcrust pastry",
      "plain flour, for dusting",
      "25g mature cheddar, finely grated",
      "200g asparagus spears, woody ends trimmed",
      "100g fresh podded or frozen peas",
      "2 eggs",
      "100g cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche",
      "150g double cream",

      "Roll the pastry out into a rectangle on a work surface lightly dusted with flour. Scatter over the cheese, fold the pastry in half and roll out again into a circle that fits a 25cm tart tin with an overhang. Chill for 20 mins. Meanwhile, cook the asparagus in boiling water for 3 mins, then drain and refresh under cold water. Cook the fresh peas the same way for a minute, or simply defrost the frozen peas.",
      "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Prick the base of the tart well with a fork, line with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake the tart for 30 mins, remove the parchment and beans, prick again if it has puffed up, then bake for another 10-15 mins until biscuit brown.",
      "Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, add the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and cream, season and add a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg. Scatter the peas and most of the watercress over the tart and crumble over half the goat\u2019s cheese. Pour over the creamy egg mixture, then lay the asparagus spears on top. Finally, slice the remaining goat\u2019s cheese and arrange on top, then bake for 25-30 mins until the custard is just set and the cheese is golden brown. Leave to cool in the tin, trim the edges of the pastry, then remove from the tin, scatter with the remaining watercress and serve cut into slices. Can be made up to a day ahead, leave out the fridge to keep the pastry crisp. "
